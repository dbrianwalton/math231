    <title>Derivatives Determine Shape</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The behavior of a function is described using the language of monotonicity and concavity. Recall that a function <m>f(x)</m> is <term>increasing on a set</term> <m>S</m> if for any <m>a,b \in S</m>, if <m>a \lt b</m> then <m>f(b) \gt f(a)</m>. Similarly, <m>f(x)</m> is <term>decreasing on a set</term> <m>S</m> if for any <m>a,b \in S</m>, if <m>a \lt b</m> then <m>f(b) \lt f(a)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mean Value Theorem provides a connection between derivatives and the properties of monotonicity. The outcomes presented in this section focus on the use of sign analysis of derivatives to identify intervals of monotonicity and concavity.

        <title>First Derivatives and Increasing/Decreasing</title>
        <p>
            The inequalities that define the properties of increasing and decreasing are related to the calculation of an average rate of change. For <m>a \lt b</m>, the inequality <m>f(b) \gt f(a)</m> is equivalent to <m>f(b) - f(a) \gt 0</m>, which is in turn equivalent to a positive average rate of change <m>\displaystyle \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \gt 0</m>. Similarly, <m>f(b) \lt f(a)</m> is equivalent to having a negative average rate of change <m>\displaystyle \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \lt 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a function is differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>, the mean value theorem connects the average rate of change to a value of <m>f'(c)</m> for some <m>c \in (a,b)</m>. This connection allows us to use sign analysis of <m>f'(x)</m> to show that <m>f(x)</m> is increasing or decreasing on intervals.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm_first_deriv_monotonicity">
            <title>First Derivative Test for Monotonicity</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is a function that is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>If <m>f'(x)</m> is <em>positive</em> on <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is <em>increasing</em> on <m>[a,b]</m>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If <m>f'(x)</m> is <em>negative</em> on <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is <em>decreasing</em> on <m>[a,b]</m>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If <m>f'(x)</m> is <em>zero</em> on <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is <em>constant</em> on <m>[a,b]</m>.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    If the continuity of <m>f(x)</m> does not extend to the end-point, then the conclusion for monotonicity may not extend to the end-point either.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    Suppose we take any two points <m>x_1,x_2 \in [a,b]</m>, with <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m>. We know <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on <m>[x_1,x_2]</m> and differentiable on <m>(x_1,x_2)</m> since these intervals are subintervals of <m>[a,b]</m>. By the Mean Value Theorem, we know that there is some $\xi \in (x_1,x_2)$ where
                    <me>\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} = f'(\xi)</me>.
                    If <m>f'(x) > 0</m> for all <m>x \in (a,b)</m>, then <m>\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} \gt 0</m> which means <m>f(x_2) \gt f(x_1)</m>.
                    Since this is true for <em>any</em> choice of <m>x_1,x_2</m>, this means <m>f(x)</m> is <em>increasing</em> on <m>[a,b]</m>.
                    By the same reasoning, the other conclusions also hold.
                </p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            For actual applications, we calculate (or are given) the function <m>f'(x)</m> and then complete sign analysis. Once we have completely found intervals where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive or negative (or possibly zero), we apply the consequence of the MVT to describe where <m>f(x)</m> is increasing or decreasing (or possibly constant). Note that we need <em>intervals</em> and not isolated points to use this result.

            <statement>

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The properties of increasing and decreasing can be found based on the signs of <m>f'(x)</m>. The first step, therefore, is to find the formula for <m>f'(x)</m> so that we can complete sign analysis.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step is to complete sign analysis. We need to find the factorization. Using either factoring by grouping or technology, we find
                    <me>f'(x) = 2(x^2-2)(2x-3)</me>.
                    The individual factors yield roots at <m>x=\pm \sqrt{2}</m> and <m>x=\frac{3}{2}</m>. (Don't be distracted by the constant factor 2, since no values of <m>x</m> make <m>2=0</m>.)
                    We mark these three points on the number line to determine our test intervals <m>(-\infty,-\sqrt{2})</m>, <m>(-\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}</m>, <m>(\sqrt{2}, \frac{3}{2})</m>, and <m>(\frac{3}{2},\infty)</m>.
                    We need to test the sign of <m>f'(x)</m>, so we calculate the sign or value of <m>f'(x)=2(x^2-2)(2x-3)</m> at points in each interval.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><m>f'(-4)=2((-4)^2-2)(2(-4)-3)=2(14)(-11) \lt 0</m> (negative)</p></li>
                        <li><p><m>f'(0)=2((0)^2-2)(2(0)-3)=2(-2)(-3) \gt 0</m> (positive)</p></li>
                        <li><p><m>f'(1.45)=2((1.45)^2-2)(2(1.45)-3)=2(0.1025)(-0.1) \lt 0</m> (negative)</p></li>

                    </ul>
                    This is shown graphically with a sign analysis summary number line.

                    We finish by interpreting the signs of <m>f'(x)</m> to say something about where <m>f(x)</m> is increasing or decreasing.
                    The original <m>f(x)</m> is continuous, so we can extend the properties of monotonicity to include the end-points.

                    Notice that we never multiplied out the denominator since that was factored already when we used the quotient rule for derivatives.
                    The zeros of the numerator are <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=\frac{5}{4}</m>, and <m>x=-4</m>, while the single zero fo the denominator is <m>x=-\frac{5}{2}</m>.
                    We test the signs of this factored formula for <m>f'(x)</m> to get a sign analysis summary shown below.

            The Mean Value Theorem gives us a tool to understand this as well.

Consequently, if we can show that <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing, the average rates of change must be increasing.

            While these examples focused on finding intervals where the function had the properties of increasing, decreasing, concave up and concave down, this information could also be used to create sketches of the function's behavior. This will be investigated further in the next section where we consider the idea of an antiderivative.
