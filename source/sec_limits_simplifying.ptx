    <title>Replacing Limit Formulas</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Our claim (still not verified) that algebraic functions are continuous so long as the value itself is defined around a point works fine when the value <em>is</em> defined.
            The most important applications of limits, however, are usually framed in terms of formulas that are <em>not</em> defined at the point of interest.
            What do we do then?
        </p>
        <p>
            This section focuses on limits where the value is undefined because the formula in question would involve division by zero.
            For algebraic formulas, this means that the denominator has a factor that evaluates to zero.
            Consequently, our approach will be to attempt to factor the numerator and denominator in the quotient of concern and see if we can find a <em>new</em> formula that eliminates that factor but has the same limit.
            That is, we want to replace the original formula that has a discontinuity at the point of interest with a new formula that is continuous.
            If we succeed, the limit is then calculated by formula evaluation.

        <title>Canceling Common Factors</title>
        <p>
            In basic algebraic formulas, the only way that a formula is undefined (see topic of domain in <xref ref="subsec_fcn_domain" />) is if we divide by zero or if we try to take an even root of a negative value.
            Limits help us understand what happens at values that are <em>not</em> in the domain of an algebraic expression.
            When a limit exists, it means the expression has a <term>removable discontinuity</term> and the graph has a corresponding <term>hole</term>.
            Sometimes, the one-sided limits will be infinite, corresponding to a graph that has a <term>vertical asymptote</term>.
            We will focus on formulas that can be factored and their associated limits.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a quotient (division), it is possible that the numerator and denominator have <em>common</em> factors.
            When working with numbers, canceling common factors is always allowed.
            But when working with functions, canceling common factors can change the domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the formula
            <me>f(x) = \frac{(x+3)(x-1)}{(x+2)(x-1)}</me>.
            Because of how this function is defined, <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=1</m> are both <em>not</em> in the domain.
            The simplified function
            <me>g(x) = \frac{x+3}{x+2}</me>
            will have a slightly larger domain, excluding only <m>x=-2</m>.
            For every value <m>x \ne 1</m>, the fraction <m>\displaystyle \frac{x-1}{x-1}</m> will simplify to 1,
            so that <m>g(x) = f(x)</m> for all <m>x \ne 1</m>.
            The graphs are the same, except that <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>hole</term> at <m>x=1</m>.

            The process of cancelling common factors from a formula leaves the <em>value</em> of the formula unchanged except at points where the common factor is zero.
            This motivates one of the main strategies for finding limits involving quotients that vanish at the limit.
            When the simplified quotient is continuous, the limit can be determined using the value of the new formula.

            We can therefore find the location of the hole in <xref ref="fig_limit_cancel_hole" />.
            The <m>x</m>-value is at <m>x=1</m>.
            The <m>y</m>-value is found from the limit, something that can be calculated by replacing the discontinuous formula with the simplified and continuous formula:
            <me>\lim_{x \to 1} f(x)  = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x+3)(x-1)}{(x+2)(x-1)} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x+3}{x+2} = \frac{1+3}{1+2} = \frac{4}{3}</me>.
            That is, the hole appears at <m>(1,\frac{4}{3})</m>.

        <p>
            For polynomials, a formula <m>p(x)</m> having a factor <m>(x-a)</m> is equivalent to having a zero <m>p(a)=0</m>.
            So if the formula of a polynomial vanishes, we <em>know</em> that there is a factor.
            A quotient of polynomials will not have common factors if the numerator is nonzero but the denominator vanishes.
            Limits with this happening have a numerator that is approaching a specific value but the denominator is approaching zero, getting smaller and smaller.

        <p>
            What happens when a number is divided by progressively smaller values?
            The value of the quotient must get larger and larger in size.
            Limits can be used to describe this behavior by saying the limit is infinite.

            Infinite limits exactly correspond to a vertical asymptote.
            In <xref ref="fig_limit_cancel_hole" />, both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> have a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-2</m> because the factor <m>x+2</m> in the denominator did not cancel away.
            From the graph, we see the left segment of the graph extends to the bottom of the graph, corresponding to
            <me>\lim_{x \to -2^-} g(x) = -\infty</me>.
            On the right segment, the graph extends to the top of the graph, corresponding to
            <me>\lim_{x \to -2^+} g(x) = +\infty</me>.

            This example is typical of limits involving quotients that result in division by zero.

                        Check if it is already continuous. If <m>p(a)/q(a)</m> is defined (any time <m>q(a) \ne 0</m>), then

                        Factor both polynomials, cancel any common factors, and then start over using the new formula (leave factored). Use technology if the formulas are hard to factor by hand.

                <p>
                    Now that we know <m>R(x) = \frac{(x-1)(x+2)(x-3)}{(x+2)^2(x-3)}</m>, we look for common factors so that we can interpret the discontinuities.
                    The factors <m>(x+2)</m> and <m>(x-3)</m> are both common factors.
                    After canceling, the simplified formula (which still is naturally undefined at <m>x=-2</m>) is
                    <me>R(x) = \frac{x-1}{x+2}, \quad x \ne 3</me>.
                    The additional constraint <m>x \ne 3</m> appears because we are talking about equality of equations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The factor <m>x+2</m> still appears in the denominator but is no longer in the numerator.
                    When we attempt to do the limit, the numerator and denominator limits result in a limit form
                    <me>\lim_{x \to -2} R(x) = \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{x-1}{x+2} \to \frac{-3}{0}</me>.
                    Having a non-zero value on top is because <m>x+2</m> is not a factor.
                    When we divide -3 by numbers closer and closer to zero, that ratio gets larger and larger in size, meaning we have an infinite limit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine the one-sided limits, we need to test the sign analysis intervals to the left and right of <m>x=-2</m>.
                    The sign analysis number line will need to have breaks at <m>x=-2</m> (denominator) and at <m>x=1</m> (numerator).
                    So if we test using <m>x=-2.1</m> and <m>x=-1.9</m>, we get the signs on the intervals:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>R(-2.1) = \frac{-2.1-1}{-2.1+2} = \frac{-3.1}{-0.1} = +31</mrow>
                        <mrow>R(-1.9) = \frac{-1.9-1}{-1.9+2} = \frac{-2.9}{+0.1} = -29</mrow>
                    </md>
                    The sign on the left is positive; the sign on the right is negative:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\lim_{x \to -2^-} R(x) = +\infty</mrow>,
                        <mrow>\lim_{x \to -2^+} R(x) = -\infty</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    Because these are different, we say the two-sided limit does not exist, writing
                    <me>\lim_{x \to -2} R(x) \; \text{d.n.e.}</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For communicating our reasoning, notice that part of our work was in explaining how we knew the limits would be infinite.
                    This is why we needed to show that <m>x+2</m> did not cancel resulting in a nonzero value divided by zero in the limit form.
                    Then we needed to provide reasoning for which infinity each side's limit approached.
                    This is why we needed to reference sign analysis and checking the signs on both sides.
                    A risk on the sign analysis step is choosing test points that are actually not in the appropriate test interval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the other limit of interest, the factor <m>x-3</m> canceled completely from the denominator in the simplification.
                    This means the reduced formula is continuous at <m>x=3</m>.
                    The value of the reduced formula will be the limit.
                    <me>\lim_{x \to 3} R(x) = \lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x-1}{x+2} = \frac{3-1}{3+2} = \frac{2}{5}</me>.
                    There is no additional required work.
