  <title>Limits</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        Functions can have widely varying behaviors.
        One of the most fundamental properties of a function is <term>continuity</term>, which is often framed in terms of connectedness.
        When a function has a break or a jump, it is <em>not</em> continuous or <term>discontinuous</term>.
        However, mathematicians realized that there is more power in the concept by thinking about continuity as saying that a value of a function is well-approximated by nearby values in the domain.
        This resulted in the development of the <term>limit</term> of a function, which is at the heart of all ideas in calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The learning objectives related to limits focus on understanding the relation between limits and continuity, particularly in terms of piecewise functions, finding limits given formulas where a function is undefined, describing the end-behavior of functions using limits, and understanding ideas related to the definition of limits and the theorems that result from that definition.
