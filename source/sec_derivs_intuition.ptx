    <title>Derivatives and Tangent Lines</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            It often helps to understand what we <em>want</em> out of a definition before we actually attempt the actual definition.
            A derivative is ultimately defined as the limit of an average rate of change over an interval as the width of the interval goes to zero.
            But to understand why this might make sense, we start by thinking geometrically about <term>tangent lines</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A function having a derivative goes one step further than a function being continuous.
            Recall that for a function <m>f</m> to be continuous at a point <m>x=a</m> means that <m>f(a)</m> is closely approximated by <m>f(x)</m> as long as <m>x</m> is chosen close enough to <m>a</m>.
            A derivative gives us additional information about <em>how close</em> the approximations will be and how much change we should expect.
            In particular, a function that has a derivative will be smooth enough so that close to <m>x=a</m>, the graph should behave <em>almost linearly</em>.
            The line that approximately matches the function is called the <term>tangent line</term>.
            The derivative is the slope of that line.

        <title>Finding a Tangent Line</title>
        <p>
            Suppose that we have the graph of a function <m>y=f(x)</m>.
            Imagine that we look at the graph around a particular point <m>(a, f(a))</m>.
            In fact, imagine we draw a small rectangle with this point in the center
            and that we could zoom into the graph so that this rectangle becomes the new viewing window.
            On a map, this would be called an <term>inset</term>.
            For smooth functions, if we make the rectangle small enough, the graph looks like a line, at least within the inset portion of the graph.
            If we allowed that line to continue outside the inset, no longer paying attention to the original graph, that line would be the tangent line.
        </p>
        <p>
            <xref ref="fig_derivs_tangent_zoom_inset" /> shows the graph of a function <m>y=f(x)</m> on a subset of the domain <m>(-5,5)</m>.
            This graph passes through the point <m>(1,-1)</m>.
            If we look at an inset around this point using a smaller subdomain <m>(0.5,1.5)</m>, the graph is almost linear.
            If we were to choose an even smaller inset, the linear behavior would be even closer.

            Now, imagine if we were to take that small inset and treat it like it initiated an actual linear function that could extend beyond the inset.
            This would create a line that closely approximated the function inside the inset.
            The line <em>is</em> the <term>tangent line</term>.

        <p>
            The idea illustrated above was that a function, when zoomed in far enough, looks like a line, and that if we were to extend that line back out to the original view of the graph, we would get a tangent line.
            Another way to imagine finding a tangent line is to imagine a line that is anchored to the point of interest <m>(a,f(a))</m> but that can rotate.
            The tangent line is the line that is chosen so that the line most closely matches the graph around the point of interest on both sides.
            Or you could imagine a ruler is placed at the point to be following the graph (tangent) and you just draw the line following the straight edge of the ruler.
        </p>
        <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m> <em>is</em> the slope of the tangent line.
            The mathematical symbol for the derivative at a point is written <m>\frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{a}</m>.
            The <m>df</m> and <m>dx</m> in the fraction are meant to remind us of a slope <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>, where the the <m>d</m> replaces <m>\Delta</m> because we will eventually be using limits.
            The subscript on the bar indicates the point of interest <m>x=a</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have an <em>approximation</em> for the graph of the tangent line, we can <em>approximate</em> the derivative by calculating the slope of the line.
            We can calculate the slope using two points chosen from the line we drew.
            Look for points that are easily estimated based on the grid used for the graph.

            We know from the graph that <m>(1,-1)</m> is one point on the tangent line.
            From the grid, it looks like <m>(-1,2.5)</m> is another point on the line.
            This is where we have some error<mdash />we can't be sure of the location of this point.
            In fact, it is closer to <m>(-1,2.55)</m>, but we wouldn't be able to eye that much accuracy.
            Our approximation for the derivative at <m>x=1</m> can now be calculated:
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{df}{dx}\Big{|}_{1} &amp; \approx \frac{-1 - 2.5}{1--1}</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp;= \frac{-3.5}{2} = -1.75</mrow>.
            </md>
            An exact value (using calculus) would have given <m>-\frac{16}{9} \approx -1.777</m>.

                    Start by marking the point on the graph at <m>x=-2</m>.
                    The point approximately looks like <m>(-2,-2.7)</m>.
                    We draw a tangent line through this point to match the slope on a very small interval here.
                    You should get a graph that looks something like the following.

                    We look for another point on the line that might be easy to estimate, and discover that the line passes through <m>(1,0)</m>.
                    Using these two points from the tangent line, we can calculate the approximate slope of the tangent line, which is the derivative at <m>x=-2</m> of the original graph.
