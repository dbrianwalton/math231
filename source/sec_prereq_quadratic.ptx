    <title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            When we need to <em>find</em> values where things of interest occur, we create and solve equations.
            There are a few key strategies that we can use to solve equations.
            Quadratic equations provide a good example to illustrate and practice several of these methods.
            In particular, we will explore methods of isolation, factoring, and the quadratic formula.
            You should be able to recognize which method is most appropriate for a given problem.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec_solving_isolation">
        <p>
            Isolation is a method where we work to get the unknown variable alone on one side of an equation so that the other side of the equation states the solution.
            This method is ideal when the equation only has one instance of the variable.
            Sometimes, when the variable appears more than once, we can group terms in a way that the equation can be rewritten with a single instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We isolate the variable by apply a sequence of inverse operations to both sides of the equation in a way that expressions reduce to make the variable on its own.
            To identify a needed inverse operation, we identify the last operation in the expression involving the variable.
            That operation's inverse will generally be the most appropriate choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            We illustrate the method first with some equations that are or reduce to simple linear equations.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_linear_isolation">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Use the method of isolation to solve the equation <m>2(3x-1)+4 = 8</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Isolation is a good method for this problem because the variable <m>x</m> appears in exactly one location, as part of the expression <m>2(3x-1)+4</m>.
                    To use isolation, we look at this expression and identify the <em>last</em> operation (according to the order of operations).
                    The expression involves multiplication by 2 and addition of 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Addition occurs <em>after</em> multiplication, so the last operation is the addition of 4.
                    What will cancel adding 4?
                    Subtracting 4, or more precisely, adding -4.
                    Our first step in isolation is to add -4 to both sides of the equation:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2(3x-1)+4 &amp;= 8</mrow>
                        <mrow>2(3x-1) &amp;= 8 + -4 = 4</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    We now have a <em>new</em> (and simpler) equation that is guaranteed to have the same solutions.
                    We say these equations are <term>equivalent</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new expression still containing <m>x</m> is <m>2(3x-1)</m>.
                    The last operation is multiplication of <m>3x-1</m> by 2.
                    The inverse operation is to multiply both sides by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2(3x-1) &amp;= 4</mrow>
                        <mrow>3x-1 &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(4) = 2</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    The new last operation is adding -1, so the inverse step is adding +1.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>3x-1 &amp;= 2</mrow>.
                        <mrow>3x &amp;= 2+1 = 3</mrow>
                    </md>
                    The only operation left is multiplication by 3, and its inverse is multiplication by <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>3x &amp;= 3</mrow>
                        <mrow>x &amp;= \frac{1}{3}(3) = 1</mrow>.
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we were to rewrite the steps without the explanatory sentences, we would have:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2(3x-1)+4 &amp;= 8</mrow>
                        <mrow>2(3x-1) &amp;= 4</mrow>
                        <mrow>3x-1 &amp;= 2</mrow>.
                        <mrow>3x &amp;= 3</mrow>.
                        <mrow>x &amp;= 1</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    There is a single solution, <m>x=1</m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <example xml:id="ex_rational_isolation">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Use the method of isolation to solve the equation 
                    <me>\frac{2}{3x-1}+4 = 8</me>.
                </p>  
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    This is essentially the same as the previous problem, even though the equation is more complex with the variable in a fraction.
                    Once we have the fraction itself isolated, we will use the reciprocal operation on both sides to transform the equation to a simpler form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you follow this example, think about what the last operation is at each step and what inverse operation will eliminate it.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{2}{3x-1}+4 &amp;= 8</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{2}{3x-1} &amp;= 8+-4 = 4</mrow>
                    </md>
                    The fraction (quotient) is isolated, so we will apply the reciprocal to both sides, reversing what is divided:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{2}{3x-1} &amp;= 4</mrow>
                        <mrow>\div \frac{2}{3x-1} &amp;= \div 4</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{3x-1}{2} &amp;= \frac{1}{4}</mrow>
                    </md>
                    We can now proceed with isolation as before:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{3x-1}{2} &amp;= \frac{1}{4}</mrow>
                        <mrow>3x-1 &amp;= 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
                        <mrow>3x &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2}</mrow>
                        <mrow>x &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Thus, our solution is <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            Isolation works with quadratic equations most simply, as noted above, when the unknown variable is present exactly once.
            If you ever learned the method of completing a square, this basically creates exactly this situation.
            The only new concern is that there will be a step where the last operation is the square (raising a term to the power 2).
            The inverse operation is the square root, except that it is not a true inverse.
            Every positive number has two roots, one positive and one negative.
            The square root only calculates the positive root.
            When we apply the square root to both sides, it is our responsibility to track both possibilities.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_quadratic_isolate_simple">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Solve the equation <m>2x^2-1=5</m> using the method of isolation.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    As we work through the operations to isolate the square, we need to remember that the order of operations have powers prioritized before multiplication and addition.
                    Our goal will be to isolate the squared value and then apply the square root to both sides.

                    </md>
                    At this point, using the square root will give two roots: <m>\pm \sqrt{3}</m>.

            At the step where we apply the square root, we should pay attention to the value opposite the square.
            If that value is positive, we will have two roots.
            If that value is zero, the square root will have only one value<mdash />zero.
            But if the value is negative, there are no real solutions because the square root will necessarily be an imaginary number.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec_solving_factoring">
        <p>
            The second major method for solving equations, and the one we will use most frequently, is factoring.
            Factoring is useful when we have an equation that is factored on one side and zero on the other.
            This is because the only way for two numbers to multiply together and give zero is if at least one of the numbers was zero to begin with.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm_factor_equal_zero">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> represent any numerical values or expressions. <m>AB = 0</m> can only occur if <m>A=0</m> or <m>B=0</m>. More generally, a product of any number of factors can equal zero only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero.

            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            Quadratic polynomials are the simplest polynomial that we learn to factor.
            So it is natural that we use quadratic equations to demonstrate this strategy.
            Polynomials of higher degree involve more complex factoring methods, and we will typically let a computer do that work for us.
            In all such problems, we must first ensure we are working with an equation that has zero on one side.
            Otherwise, factoring does not help us at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Factoring quadratics is also called factoring <term>trinomials</term> because a typical quadratic has three terms.
            The standard form of a quadratic is <m>ax^2+bx+c = 0</m>, where <m>a,b,c</m> are constants known as the coefficients.
            A useful strategy to factor a trinomial quadratic with <em>integer</em> coefficients is to multiply the leading coefficient <m>a</m> by the constant coefficient <m>c</m> to get a number.
            We want to find numerical factors of that product <m>ac</m> that <em>add</em> to give the coefficient <m>b</m>.
            In doing this, we need to remember that possible factors can be positive or negative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we find these factors <m>pq = ac</m> with <m>p+q=b</m>, we will rewrite the quadratic as <em>four</em> terms, <m>ax^2+px+qx+c</m> because <m>bx = (p+q)x = px+qx</m>.
            Because <m>pq=ac</m>, the groups <m>ax^2+px</m> and <m>qx+c</m> are guaranteed to have a common factor.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will illustrate with a few examples.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_quadratic_factor_simple">

                    Solve the equation <m>x^2-4x=12</m> using factoring.

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Recall that to use factoring, the equation must have a zero on one side.
                    We need to eliminate the 12:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x^2-4x &amp;= 12</mrow>

                    </md>
                    We can now identify <m>a=1</m>, <m>b=-4</m>, and <m>c=-12</m>.
                    Notice how we must include the signs as part of the coefficients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The product <m>ac=1(-12) = -12</m> needs to be factored.
                    If you can think through factors in your head, that is great.
                    Otherwise, it can be helpful to create a table of possible factors.

                    </tabular>
                    Because <m>b=-4</m>, we want to use <m>p=-6</m> and <m>q=2</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will now rewrite the trinomial using four terms and group the resulting pairs, which we use to look for common factors:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x^2-4x -12 &amp;= 0</mrow>

                    We see that each pair has the common factor <m>x-6</m>.
                    Factoring this out, we have our factorization.

                    Once the equation is factored, we can consider each factor separately.
                    One possibility is that <m>x+2=0</m>, which has a solution <m>x=-2</m>.
                    The other possibility is that <m>x-6=0</m>, which has a solution <m>x=6</m>.
                    The factoring theorem guarantees that these are the only possible solutions.

                    The product of the quadratic and constant coefficients is <m>ac=-24</m>.

            The methods of isolation and factoring are the preferred methods because they are more generalizable to other problems and tend to result in simplified answers.
            The method illustrated for factoring a quadratic might break down if we can not find factors <m>p,q</m> so that <m>pq=ac</m> and <m>p+q=b</m>.
            In that case, we can use the method of the quadratic formula.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quadratic formula is justified by knowing that any quadratic <em>can</em> be rewritten so that isolation can be applied.
            However, once the equation is written in standard form and we know the coefficients <m>a,b,c</m>, the calculation from that point is always the same.
            Beware, however, that this is specific to quadratic equations.

        <p>
            Just as when doing isolation the step involving the square root can have two, one, or zero solutions, the quadratic formula has the same issue.
            If <m>b^2-4ac \lt 0</m>, the solutions are complex numbers and the equation has no real solutions.

                    The quadratic is already in standard form, so we can identify our coefficients <m>a=3</m>, <m>b=-3</m>, and <m>c=-8</m>.
                    The product of the quadratic and constant coefficients is <m>ac=-24</m>.
                    There are no factors <m>p,q</m> so that <m>pq=-24</m> and <m>p+q = -3</m>, as illustrated by the partial factoring table below.
