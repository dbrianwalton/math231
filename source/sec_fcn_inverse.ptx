    <title>Inverse Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In the context of covarying variables, a function is a rule (operation) that predicts the value of the dependent variable (output) given the value of the independent variable (input).
            The algebra equation <m>y=f(x)</m> indicates that an <em>independent</em> variable <m>x</m> can lead to the value of the dependent variable <m>y</m> using the function <m>f</m>.
            We think of this as a map <m>x \mapsto y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We might be interested in predicting the reverse relation <m>y \mapsto x</m>.
            That is, it may also be the case that knowing <m>y</m>, we can calculate the value of <m>x</m>.
            Algebra and pre-calculus courses teach the idea that this is only possible when <m>f</m> is <term>one-to-one</term>, meaning that the value of <m>y</m> can only come from a single value of <m>x</m>.
            When this is true for a function <m>f</m>, we can talk about <m>f^{-1}</m> as a new function, called the <term>inverse function</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This inverse function <em>undoes</em> the calculation of <m>f</m>.
            Suppose <m>f : x \mapsto y</m> has an inverse function <m>f^{-1}: y \mapsto x</m>.
            If we know that <m>f(3) = 5</m>, this means <m>x=3 \mapsto y=5</m>.
            The inverse function would map <m>y=5 \mapsto x=3</m> or <m>f^{-1}(5)=3</m>.
            This can be true when variables are involved as well: <m>f(a) = 4</m> means <m>f^{-1}(4) = a</m>.
            So if we are solving an equation <m>f(x) = 4</m>, the solution would be <m>x=f^{-1}(4)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may remember learning something about the graph of an inverse function being a reflection of the graph of the original.
            If a point <m>(a,b)</m> is on the graph <m>y=f(x)</m>, this means <m>f(a)=b</m>.
            The inverse function has <m>f^{-1}(b)=a</m> so that <m>(b,a)</m> is on the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
            Every point on the graph of <m>f</m> corresponds to a point on the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m> where the coordinates have reversed.
            Visually, this creates a reflection across the line <m>y=x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of <em>undoing</em> the function is demonstrated through <em>composition</em>.
            If we start with an equation
            <me>y=f(x)</me>,
            look at what happens if we use composition by <m>f^{-1}</m> to both sides of the equation:
            <me>f^{-1}(y)=f^{-1}\big(f(x)\big)</me>.
            We know that <m>f^{-1}(y) = x</m> is the inverse map, so the equation becomes
            <me>x=f^{-1}\big(f(x)\big)</me>.
            That is, a function composed with its inverse function is the same as doing nothing to the input, an operation called the <term>identity function</term>.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def_identity">
            <title>Identity Function</title>
            <statement>
                The <term>identity function</term> is a function that returns the same value as its input, <m>\mathrm{id}(x) = x</m>.
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Because some functions may not be represented using formulas, inverse functions need a definition other than rules on how to manipulate formulas.
            Mathematicians have found that the idea of composition creating the identity function is useful and have adopted that as the official definition of an inverse function.

        <title>Using Inverse Functions</title>
        <p>
            The fundamental idea of inverse functions is that whenever we have composition <m>f \circ f^{-1}</m> or <m>f^{-1} \circ f</m>, this is identical to the <em>identity function</em>.
            We explore this idea by solving an equation where some of the operations are not arithmetic but are invertible functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recall that the <term>method of isolation</term> is a strategy to solve an equation by applying the same operation on both sides of an equation to cancel away operations until the unknown variable is isolated.
            Early examples of this strategy focused on operations involving basic arithmetic.
            We can now add to this strategy the use of inverse functions to cancel away operations represented by functions.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_fcn_inverse_solve_simple">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverse functions.
                    Solve the equation <m>f(2x) = 3</m> in terms of values of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Problems like this may feel unnatural because we don't even know what these functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> might be.
                    Suppose it were a familiar function, say <m>\sqrt{2x} = 3</m>.
                    We would want to get rid of the square root and would do this by squaring both sides.
                    That is, we would use an <em>inverse operation</em>.
                    We will do the same thing here, except the inverse operation to <m>f</m> as a function is the function <m>g</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting with the original equation, we use composition with the inverse <m>g</m> on both sides of the equation:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(2x) &amp;= 3</mrow>
                        <mrow>g(f(2x)) &amp;= g(3).</mrow>
                    </md>
                    The composition <m>g \circ f</m> reduces to the identity function, which just leaves the input expression.
                    The equation therefore becomes:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>g(f(2x)) &amp;= g(3)</mrow>
                        <mrow>2x &amp;= g(3)</mrow>
                        <mrow>x &amp;= \frac{1}{2} g(3).</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Because we have isolated <m>x</m> and the value is a formula involving <m>g(3)</m>, we are done.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            Sometimes we need to use additional operations in order to isolate the function of an expression before using the inverse function.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_fcn_inverse_solve_complex">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are inverse functions.
                    Solve the equation <m>3T(2x+1) - 4 = 1</m> in terms of values of <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The method of isolation should work because the equation involves the variable <m>x</m> in only one place.
                    We will identify the last operation on the side involving the variable and apply inverse operations until we have finished isolating <m>x</m>.

        <title>Verifying Inverse Functions</title>
        <p>
            The learning objective that this subsection focuses on is on the what it means to <em>verify</em> that two functions satisfy the <em>definition</em> of being inverses.
            The emphasis in your past was likely about <em>finding</em> an inverse function.
            In mathematics, <term>definitions</term> play a critical role in creating the language we use to describe objects.
            A definition is a statement that can be true or false.
            To show that something satisfies a definition, we need to show that the statement in the definition is <em>true</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consequently, to verify that two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverses, we need to construct the compositions <m>f \circ g(x)</m> and <m>g \circ f(x)</m>.
            If both of these compositions reduce to the identity function, then they satisfy the definition.
            Along the way, we need to practice simplify formulas that involve compositions.
            This is the second reason that we have this learning objective<mdash />practicing thinking about the structure of formulas and how the order of operations impacts what does or does not simplify.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we look at a formula, we should identify the order in which the different operations take place.
            When we find operations that are inverses one after another, they can be canceled.
            But operations that are inverses of one another but occur out of sequence will not cancel.
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>

                    Notice that in one spot we add -1 and in another we add +1.
                    These are inverse operations.
                    However, they were not applied in sequence so they do not cancel at this point.

                    On the other hand, the composition with <m>h</m> and <m>h^{-1}</m> do occur in sequence after one another and so they cancel to leave the identity function:

                <p>
                    When we now consider the second expression,
                    <m>\frac{1}{2} h(h^{-1}(2x-1))+1</m>,
                    we look for inverse operations that are sequentially in order.
                    We could think through the order of operations as above.
                    Or we can directly look for sequential operations that cancel.
                    There are three potential operations that cancel:
                    <ul>
                        <li>multiplication by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and by 2,</li>
                        <li>addition with <m>-1</m> and <m>+1</m>,</li>
                        <li>composition of <m>h</m> and <m>h^{-1}</m>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    However, notice that the operations of multiplication by 2 and addition of -1 are <em>inside</em>  the composition with <m>h^{-1}</m>:
                    <me>\frac{1}{2} h(h^{-1}(\boxed{2x-1}))+1</me>.
                    This prevents them being canceled.
                    However, the composition of <m>h</m> and <m>h^{-1}</m> are back-to-back and cancel to an identity function,
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{1}{2} h(\boxed{h^{-1}(2x-1)})+1 &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (\boxed{2x-1})+1</mrow>

                    </md>
                    Now we distribute the multiplication by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> over the addition in <m>2x-1</m>.
                    <md>
                        <mrow> \frac{1}{2}(2x-1)+1 &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(2x) - \frac{1}{2}(1) + 1</mrow>

            When verifying if two functions satisfy the definition of being inverses, we must first create the two compositions.
            Then we use the process illustrated in the previous example to simplify as much as possible.
            If the formulas of the compositions both simplify to just <m>x</m>, then we have the composition being equal to the identity function as required by the definition.
            Otherwise, they do not satisfy the definition and are not inverses.

                    Consequently, we need to create the formulas for <m>f \circ g(x) = f \big(g(x)\big)</m> and <m>g \circ f(x) = g \big(f(x)\big)</m>.
                    Then we will need to simplify the formulas, canceling terms where appropriate, and see if they reduce to <m>x</m> or something more complicated.

                <p>

                    </md>
                    We are looking for inverse operations that are back-to-back steps.
                    Notice that the last operation in <m>g(x)</m> was adding -1
                    and the first operation in <m>f(x)</m> was adding 1.
                    These cancel one another:

                        <mrow>f \circ g(x) &amp;= 5 h^{-1}\left(\frac{2 h\left(\frac{x-3}{5}\right) - \cancel{1}+\cancel{1}}{2}\right) + 3</mrow>

                    </md>
                    Now we see that in the input to <m>h^{-1}</m>, there is multiplication by 2 and division by 2 back-to-back that cancel:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f \circ g(x) &amp;= 5 h^{-1}\left(\frac{\cancel{2} h\left(\frac{x-3}{5}\right)}{\cancel{2}}\right) + 3</mrow>

                    </md>
                    Now we have a composition of inverses <m>h^{-1} \circ h</m> that reduces to the identity, after which we use algebra to simplify:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f \circ g(x) &amp;= 5 h^{-1} \circ h\left(\frac{x-3}{5}\right) + 3</mrow>

                    We have shown that <m>f \circ g(x) = x</m>, which is half of the required work to show they are inverses.

        <title>Finding Inverse Functions</title>
        <p>
            Because an inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m> is designed specifically to undo the operations of <m>f</m>, we can often find a formula for <m>f^{-1}</m> by either literally reversing the operations or by solving an equation.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_fcn_inverse_find_simple">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find a formula for <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> given the function
                    <me>f(x) = \frac{2}{3x+1} - 4</me>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We know that if <m>y=f(x)</m>, then an inverse function would give <m>x=f^{-1}(y)</m>.
                    So one approach to finding a formula is to solve the equation to isolate <m>x</m> and use the formula in terms of <m>y</m> as the inverse formula.
                    We start with the equation
                    <me>y = f(x) = \frac{2}{3x+1} - 4</me>.
                    We now try to isolate the variable <m>x</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>y &amp;= \frac{2}{3x+1} - 4</mrow>
                        <mrow>y + 4 &amp;= \frac{2}{3x+1} - \cancel{4} + \cancel{4}</mrow>
                        <mrow>y + 4 &amp;= \frac{2}{3x+1}</mrow>
                    </md>
                    At this point, it is easiest to apply the reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) to both sides:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>y + 4 &amp;= \frac{2}{3x+1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{1}{y + 4} &amp;= \frac{3x+1}{2}</mrow>

                        <mrow>\frac{2}{y + 4} &amp;= 3x+1</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{2}{y + 4} - 1 &amp;= 3x</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{2}{y + 4} - 1\right) &amp;= x</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Because we finished solving for <m>x</m> and have a formula in terms of <m>y</m>,
                    that formula can be used to define <m>f^{-1}(y)</m>.
                    If we think of <m>x</m> as an abstract variable and not a physical quantity, we can use that in place of <m>y</m> to get
                    <me>f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{y+4} - 1\right)</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, the inverse function can be constructed by literally undoing the operations occuring in the function <m>f</m>.

            the learning objective assessments will typically involve calculations involving some invertible function.

                    We could combine the terms on the left to a single fraction if we use a common denominator:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{5}{y+3} - \frac{y+3}{y+3} = h(2x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{5-(y+3)}{y+3} = h(2x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{2-y}{y+3} = h(2x)</mrow>
                    </md>
                    At this point, we need to cancel the composition with <m>h</m> and do this by using a composition with <m>h^{-1}</m> on both sides.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>h^{-1}\left(\frac{2-y}{y+3}\right) = h^{-1} \circ h(2x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>h^{-1}\left(\frac{2-y}{y+3}\right) = 2x</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{1}{2} h^{-1}\left(\frac{2-y}{y+3}\right) = x</mrow>
                    </md>
                    This formula gives us the relation <m>y \mapsto x</m> which must be <m>f^{-1}</m>:
                    <me>f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{2} h^{-1}\left(\frac{2-y}{y+3}\right)</me>.
                    If we considered the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as abstract values rather than physical measurements, we can replace <m>y</m> with any variable:
                    <me>f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{2} h^{-1}\left(\frac{2-x}{x+3}\right)</me>.
