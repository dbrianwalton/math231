        <p>
            The rules of differentiation are not just about finding <em>formulas</em> for derivatives.
            They also provide a way to relate the rates of change of different quantities that are themselves related.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many physical quantities are related to one another and equations are used to define these relationships.
            A sphere has many different measurable attributes, such as the volume, the surface area, the diameter, and the radius.
            Equations relate the measurements, such as relating volume and radius by <m>V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m> or relating surface area and radius by <m>A = 4 \pi r^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some quantities are defined by equations in terms of other quantities.
            A population that occupies area is often understood in terms of its population density, which is calculated as the size of the population divided by the area occupied by that population, represented by an equation
            <me>D = \frac{P}{A}</me>.
            Similarly, total cost <m>C</m> is often calculated as a unit price <m>P</m> times the amount <m>A</m> of the whatever is being purchased, which might be represented by an equation
            <me>C = P \cdot A</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When quantities change with respect to time, all of the different related quantities become functions of time.
            They also have their own rates of change with respect to time.
            For the example of a population, the size of the population, the area it occupies, and the population density will all be functions of time with their own rates of change.
            In this section, we will apply the rules of differentiation treating the different quantities within the equation as functions of time to create equations relating their rates of change.

        <title>Related Rates from Geometry</title>
        <p>
            Equations from geometry provide many examples for related rates.
            Instead of finding formulas for the physical quantities, we really only need to know the values of the quantities and their rates of change.
        </p>

                    A raindrop in the form of a sphere evaporates as it falls.
                    Suppose that as the raindrop is falling, it has a radius of 0.8 mm that is decreasing at a rate of 0.05 mm/s.
                    Find how fast the raindrop is losing water.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    For application problems, one of the key challenges is simply interpreting the question.
                    In this problem, we are asked a question about <em>how fast</em>, which should be interpreted as finding a <em>rate of change</em>.
                    Specifically, we want to find how fast the raindrop is <em>losing water</em>.
                    How do we measure how much water is in a raindrop?
                    That will be a <em>volume</em> of water.
                    So we are being asked to find the rate of change of the volume of the raindrop.
                    If we write <m>V</m> for volume and <m>t</m> for time, we need to find <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m>, the instantaneous rate of change of volume with respect to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second challenge of application problems is interpreting what information we are given.
                    We are told a value of the radius (in millimeters) and how fast it is changing (in millimeters per second).
                    We need a variable for the radius, say <m>r</m>.
                    The given information is the value <m>r=0.8</m> mm.
                    When we are given a rate of change, that is a derivative, in this case <m>\frac{dr}{dt} = -0.05</m> mm/s.
                    The value is negative because we know the radius is <em>decreasing</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we identify what information is given and what information is desired, we identify equations relating the quantities.
                    From geometry, we start with the equation relating volume <m>V</m> and radius <m>r</m>,
                    <me>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</me>.
                    In this equation, both <m>V</m> and <m>r</m> need to be considered as <em>functions</em> of time <m>t</m>, which does not directly appear in the geometric equation.
                    Using function notation, the equation would be rewritten
                    <me>V(t) = \frac{4}{3} \pi (r(t))^3</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the related rates equation, we need to compute the derivative <em>with respect to time</em>.
                    Because the radius function is raised to a power, the derivative will require the chain rule.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} = V'(t) &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[ \frac{4}{3} \pi (r(t))^3 \right]</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{d}{dr}[r^3] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[r(t)]</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 3 r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= 4 \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}</mrow>
                    </md>
                    In the chain rule, the derivative of the outside was <m>\frac{dV}{dr}</m> while the derivative of the inside was <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have the related rates equation, we use the known values to solve for the unknown value.
                    We know at the instant in question <m>r=0.8</m> mm and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}=-0.05</m> mm/s.
                    We substitute these values into the equation to get
                    <me>\frac{dV}{dt} = 4 \pi (0.8 \, \text{mm})^2 \cdot (-0.05 \, \text{mm/s}) = -0.128 \pi \, \text{mm}^3/\text{s} \approx -0.4021 \, \text{mm}^3/\text{s}</me>.
                    A negative rate of change occurs because the volume is also decreasing as time passes.

                    Two vehicles are traveling along separate straight roads that meet at a perpendicular intersection.
                    At a particular instant, the vehicle on one road is 0.25 miles away and approaching the intersection at 30 miles per hour, while the other vehicle on the other road is 0.5 miles from the intersection and traveling toward the intersection at 40 miles per hour. Find the rate of change of the distance between the vehicles and determine if the distance is increasing or decreasing.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    For geometric problems, it is often helpful to draw a picture representing the different quantities involved.
                    In this example, we have two roads that are perpendicular, which will correspond to two perpendicular lines.
                    The locations of the vehicles will be points along the line.
                    The distance between the vehicles will correspond to the length of the line segment directly joining the two points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are working with a right triangle.
                    Let <m>A</m> measure the distance the first vehicle is from the intersection (along the vertical road), and let <m>B</m> measure the distance the second vehicle is from the intersection (along the horizontal road), so that the length of the hypotenuse <m>C</m> is the distance between the two vehicles.

                <p>
                    From the provided information about the instant in question,
                    we know the distances from the intersection are <m>A = 0.25</m> mile and <m>B = 0.5</m> mile
                    as well as the rates of change <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = +30</m> mph (because this distance is increasing) and <m>\frac{dB}{dt} = -40</m> mph (because this distance is decreasing).
                    We are asked to find <m>\frac{dC}{dt}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having identified the quantities we know and what we need to find, we need to find an equation that relates the quantities <m>A, B, C</m>.
                    Because the triangle is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem gives us the equation we need,
                    <me>C^2 = A^2+B^2</me>.
                    Notice that we don't need to <em>solve</em> for <m>C</m>, if we think of the equation as relating the <em>squared distance</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We find the related rates equation by creating a new equation about the rates of change. With two different sides to the equation for the squared distance, we will calculated the derivative of both sides of the equation and they must be equal to one another.
                    Remember that all of our variables <m>A, B, C</m> are actually functions of time.
                    On the left, we have the derivative of the square of <m>C</m>, which will require a chain rule (outside <m>C^2</m>, inside <m>C(t)</m>),
                    <me>\frac{d}{dt}[\left(C(t)\right)^2] = \frac{d}{dC}[C^2] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[C(t)] = 2C \cdot \frac{dC}{dt}</me>.
                    On the right, we have the derivative of the <em>sum</em> of the squares of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, which will again require the chain rule on each square,
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}[\left(A(t)\right)^2 + \left(B(t)\right)^2] &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}[\left(A(t)\right)^2] + \frac{d}{dt}[\left(B(t)\right)^2]</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{d}{dA}[A^2] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[A(t)] + \frac{d}{dB}[B^2] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[B(t)]</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= 2A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + 2B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    Consequently, the related rates equation is
                    <me>2C \cdot \frac{dC}{dt} = 2A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + 2B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we have this equation, notice that it involves three different variables and three rates of change.
                    Our goal is to find the value of <m>\frac{dC}{dt}</m>.
                    If we solve for that in the equation, we get
                    <me>\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}}{C}</me>.
                    We now all of the values required for the numerator, but we were not provided a value for <m>C</m>.
                    The original equation allows to solve for <m>C</m> based on the values of <m>A,B</m>,
                    <me>C = \sqrt{A^2+B^2} = \sqrt{(0.25)^2+(0.5)^2} = \sqrt{0.3125} \approx 0.5590 \, \text{mile}</me>.
                    Using the values, we find
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dC}{dt} &amp;= \frac{A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}}{C}</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{(0.25 \, \text{mi})(30 \, \text{mi}/\text{hr}) + (0.50 \, \text{mi})(-40 \, \text{mi}/\text{hr})}{0.5590 \, \text{mi}}</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;\approx -22.36 \, \text{mi}/\text{hr}</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    Notice how the units work out to give a speed in miles per hour.
                    Because the rate of change is negative, we know that the distance between the vehicles is actually decreasing at this instant.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            Well known formulas for area and volume often appear in related rates problems.
            A rectangle of length <m>L</m> and width <m>W</m> has an area
            <me>A = L \cdot W</me>.
            A circle of radius <m>r</m> has an area <me>A = \pi r^2</me>.
            A rectangular box with dimensions length <m>L</m>, width <m>W</m>, and height <m>H</m> has a volume
            <me>V = L \cdot W \cdot H</me>
            and a total surface area calculated as the sum of areas of six rectangles
            <me>SA = 2 LW + 2 LH + 2 WH</me>.
            A circular cone with a top face with radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> has volume
            <me>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many times different variables are related to one another in terms of <em>similar triangles</em>.
            This means that there is a similarity ratio or proportionality constant.
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Water cups by a water cooler have the shape of a circular cone with a diameter at the top that is 8 cm and that has a total height of 10 cm.
                    If water is being added to the cup at a rate of <m>10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}</m>, how fast is the height changing when the water is at a height of 5 cm?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    What variables are involved?
                    The water filling the cup forms the shape of a circular cone that fits inside of the cup.
                    Consequently, the radii and heights of the cup and the water cone form similar triangles.
                    Let <m>r</m> be the radius of the cone of water at the surface and let <m>h</m> be the height or depth of water in the cup.
                    By similarity, we require the ratios <m>r/4</m> and <m>h/10</m> be equal,
                    which results in an equation
                    <me>\frac{r}{4} = \frac{h}{10} \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad 10r = 4h</me>.

                    We next interpret the quantities that are provided.
                    At the instant in question, we are told water is being added at a rate of <m>10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}</m>.
                    This is a rate of change and so should be interpreted as a derivative of some quantity.
                    The units <m>\text{cm}^3</m> indicates that we are looking at the rate of change of volume, which makes sense because we can measure the amount of water using units of volume.
                    In addition, we know that the height of water is <m>h=5 \, \text{cm}</m>.
                    Finally, we are asked to find how fast the height is changing, which means our task is to find the derivative <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to create an equation that relates the height and volume of water in the cup.
                    Using the geometric formula for volume of a circular cone, we start with
                    <me>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</me>.
                    One approach is to use the similarity equation to solve for <m>r</m> as a function of <m>h</m>,
                    <me> r = \frac{4h}{10} = \frac{2}{5} h</me>,
                    so that we can write
                    <me>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{2}{5} h\right)^2 \cdot h = \frac{4}{75} \pi h^3</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> are both functions of time, we use the chain rule to find the related rates equation
                    <me>\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{4}{75} \pi \cdot 3h^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}</me>.
                    Substituting in the known values, we have an equation leaving <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> as the only unknown,

                    </md>
                    Solving for the unknown rate, we find

                        <mrow>\frac{dh}{dt} &amp;= \frac{10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}}{4 \pi \, \text{cm}^2}</mrow>

                <p>
                    A second approach to this problem is to use the original equation involving both <m>r</m> and <m>h</m>.
                    Differentiation this time requires the product rule and the chain rule to give
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[ \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right]</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \pi \frac{d}{dt}\left[ r^2 \cdot h\right]</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{d}{dt}[r^2] \cdot h + r^2 \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[h]\right)</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(2r \frac{dr}{dt} \cdot h + r^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}\right)</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Notice that this approach introduces two additional unknowns, <m>r</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
                    We can find <m>r</m> from the similarity relation as <m>r = 2\,\text{cm}</m>.
                    The similarity relation also leads to a related rates equation between <m>r</m> and <m>h</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>10r &amp;= 4h</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}[10r] &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}[4h]</mrow>
                        <mrow>10 \frac{dr}{dt} &amp;= 4\frac{dh}{dt}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{dr}{dt} &amp;= \frac{4}{10} \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{dh}{dt}</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Making these substitutions and solving for <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> will result in the same answer as the first approach.

            Any quantities related by an equation can result in related rates.
            They don't need to be geometric.
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    The total annual wage costs for a company is equal to the number of employees times the average wages for an employee. A company with 800 employees is paying an average annual wage of $45,000. If the company is shrinking it work force at a rate of 50 employees per year while the annual wage is increasing at rate of 10% per year, determine the rate of change of the total annual wage costs.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    There are three different quantities being discussed: the average annual wage <m>w</m>, the number of employees<m>n</m>, and the total annual wages for the company <m>T</m>.
                    The question of the problem is to find <m>\frac{dT}{dt}</m>.
                    We start with values <m>n=800</m> and <m>w=45000</m>.
                    Because the company's work force is shrinking, we have a <em>negative</em> rate of change <m>\frac{dn}{dt} = -50</m> per year.
                    The annual wage is increasing by a percentage rate, so we need to multiply the current wage rate by 10% to find
                    <me>\frac{dw}{dt} = 0.10 \cdot 45000 = 4500 \, \text{dollars}/\text{year}</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relation between these variables is given by the equation
                    <me>T = n \cdot w</me>.
                    The related rates equation is found by differentiating, remembering that each of the variables is actually a function of time <m>t</m>.
                    <me>\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}[n \cdot w]</me>.
                    Because the formula has a product, we must use the product rule.
                    <me>\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{dn}{dt} \cdot w + n \cdot \frac{dw}{dt}</me>.
                    Using the given values, we find
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dT}{dt} &amp;= (-50 / \text{year}) \cdot (45000 \, \text{dollars}) + (800) \cdot (4500 \, \text{dollars}/\text{year})</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= -2250000 \, \text{dollars}/\text{year} + 3600000 \, \text{dollars}/\text{year}</mrow>

                    </md>
                    Because the calculated rate of change is positive, the total wage costs for the company are increasing.
                </p>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    In 2020, the population in Harrisonburg, Virginia, was 51,675 and was decreasing by 245 people per year. That year, the city budget was $271.3 million, and the annual budget was decreasing at a rate $1.43 million per year.
                    What is the rate of change of the per capita expense of running the city?
                    Is the per person expense increasing or decreasing?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The idea of <q>per capita</q> is to divide the total amount of something by the size of the population, in order to identify the amount that would be carried per individual as if all individuals were considered equivalent.
                    In this case, the per capita expense <m>E</m> is the total budget <m>B</m> divided by the size of the population <m>P</m>,
                    <me>E = \frac{B}{P}</me>.
                    The question in this example is to find <m>\frac{dE}{dt}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the equation involves a quotient, we would use the quotient rule to find the related rates equation,
                    <me>\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{P \frac{dB}{dt} - B \frac{dP}{dt}}{P^2}</me>.
                    From the given information, we find <m>P=51675</m> (people) and <m>\frac{dP}{dt}=-245</m> (people per year) while <m>B=271.3</m> (million dollars) and <m>\frac{dB}{dt}=-1.43</m> (million dollars per year).
                    Substituting these values into the related rates equation, we find
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dE}{dt} &amp;= \frac{51675 \cdot (-1.43) - 271.3 \cdot (-245)}{(51675)^2}</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= -2.78 \times 10^{-6}</mrow>.
                    </md>
                    The units will be millions of dollars per person per year, so we see that the per person expense of Harrisonburg in 2020 was decreasing by $2.78 per person per year.
