    <title>Sign Analysis to Solve Inequalities</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            When we want to find individual values where something precisely occurs, we solve equations.
            This typically results in solution sets of isolated points.
            On the other hand, we are often interested in where a quantity is in a <em>range</em> of possible values.
            The mathematical question then becomes solving an <term>inequality</term>.
            The solution set then typically becomes a set consisting of intervals and possibly additional isolated points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, the method of solving an equation can be used to solve inequalities.
            Equations help us find boundaries of possible regions.
            An inequality is solved by testing the regions one at a time.
            This method is commonly called <term>sign analysis</term>.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec_inequality_overview">
        <p>
            An inequality is a logical statement that includes the possibility that one quantity is greater than or less than another inequality.
            This allows inequalities to answer questions about when a quantity is within a given range of values.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an inequality has a variable that appears only once,
            we can use the strategy of isolation to solve the inequality,
            assuming that the inverse operations we apply are well-behaved.
        </p>
        <p>
            What could go wrong?
            The first thing to watch out for is that some operations change the ordering.
            For example, you should have learned that multiplying by a negative number reverses order.
            That is, if we start with <m>u \lt v</m> and multiply by -2, we have <m>-2u \gt -2v</m>.
            Another example is a reciprocal of two numbers of the same sign.
            If we start with <m>0 \lt u \lt v</m> (two positive numbers), then since <m>v</m> would be a larger denominator, <m>0 \lt \frac{1}{v} \lt \frac{1}{u}</m>.
            Being the same sign is important.
            If <m>u \lt 0 \lt v</m>, then <m>\frac{1}{u} \lt 0 \lt \frac{1}{v}</m> because the reciprocal does not change the sign, only the magnitude, of the number.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_inequality_isolation">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find the values <m>x</m> so that <m>y=3x-5</m> is between <m>y=4</m> and <m>y=5</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We start by translating the question into an inequality,
                    <me>4 \lt 3x-5 \lt 5</me>.
                    Technically, this is a compound inequality that <m>3x-5 \gt 4</m> <em>and</em> <m>3x-5 \lt 5</m>.
                    Normally this would require solving the simpler inequalities individually and then finding the <em>intersection</em> (because <em>and</em> means intersect) of the solutions.
                    <me>
                        \begin{array}{c c}
                        3x-5 \gt 4 &amp; 3x-5 \lt 5 \\
                        3x \gt 4+5 &amp; 3x \lt 5+5 \\
                        3x \gt 9 &amp; 3x \lt 10 \\
                        x \gt 3 &amp; x \lt \frac{10}{3}
                        \end{array}
                    </me>
                    The first inequality's solution set is <m>(3,\infty)</m>.
                    The second inequality's solution set is <m>(-\infty, \frac{10}{3})</m>.
                    The intersection of these sets is <m>(3, \frac{10}{3})</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For linear formulas, the method of isolation works on the compound inequality together because we only deal with addition and multiplication:

                    </md>
                    This is a much easier way to get the interval.

            The geometric interpretation of solving the inequality of the previous example is helpful.
            The equation <m>y=3x-5</m> defines a set of points (a line) in the plane.
            Solving <m>4 \lt 3x-5 \lt 5</m> is finding the <m>x</m>-values of the points that are between <m>y=4</m> and <m>y=5</m>.

            The boundaries of our solution set exactly correspond to where the graph <m>y=3x-5</m> intersects the threshold values <m>y=4</m> and <m>y=5</m>.
            Finding the intersection points corresponds to solving equations <m>3x-5=4</m> and <m>3x-5=5</m>.
            Once we know those points, we can just check each of the intervals using these end-points to find our solution set.
            This is what motivates the strategy of sign analysis to solve inequalities.

        <p>
            The method of <term>sign analysis</term> uses equations to find end-points of test intervals and sign checking inside of intervals as an approach to solve inequalities.
            The word <em>sign</em> is used because we will be reframing each inequality in terms of comparisons to zero (equal, positive, or negative).
            By relating to zero, we can take advantage of factoring as a strategy for solving the equations <em>and</em> for testing signs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, the strategy of sign analysis is justified by the idea of continuity, a concept introduced in calculus later.
            For our purposes, algebraic formulas that we encounter are continuous except where they are not defined due to division by zero.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm_sign_change">
            <title>Sign Change Locations</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    An expression involving a variable <m>x</m> can only change sign at a point where the expression equals zero or is not continuous.
                    That is, if the expression has no zeros or discontinuities between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m>, then the sign of the expression can not change inside the interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            This theorem allows us to find all of the points where an expression equals zero or is not continuous.
            Using these points as end-points, we create test intervals that can only have one sign on the interval.
            By choosing a single point from each interval, we can calculate the sign at that point and conclude the sign on the entire interval.
            Once we know the signs for each interval and point, we can interpret the results to solve an inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simplest example to demonstrate this principle is for polynomials.
            Our first step will be to rewrite the inequality of interest as a relation to zero.
            Polynomials do not involve any division by the variable, so there will be no discontinuities.
            Roots (zeros) can be determined by the factorization.
            For polynomials of degree larger than 2, we will use a computer to help us factor.

                    the solution we are looking for is the set of <m>x</m>-values where the first graph is <em>below</em> (less than) the second graph.

                <p>
                    To solve this question directly, we rewrite the inequality as a relation with zero:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x^4-x^3-8x^2+2 \lt 5x^2-x-10</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^4-x^3-8x^2+2 - 5x^2 + x + 10 \lt 0</mrow>

                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point we need to factor the polynomial.
                    Because this is degree 4, we will use a computer to solve.
                    One approach would be to go to <url href="https://wolframalpha.com" visual="wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</url> and type <c>factor x^4-x^3-9x^2+2x+8</c>.
                    Another would be to use the free tool <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org" visual="sagecell.sagemath.org">SageMath</url>, as illustrated below.
                </p>
                <sage>
                    <input>
var('x')
formula = x^4 - x^3 - 13*x^2 + x + 12
show(formula.factor())
                    </input>
                    <output>
                        (x+3)(x+1)(x-1)(x-4)
                    </output>
                </sage>
                <p>
                    On evaluation of the factoring, we can rewrite our question
                    <me>(x+3)(x+1)(x-1)(x-4) \lt 0</me>.
                    Because this is already factored, we can quickly note that the only roots (zeros) occur at four locations: <m>x=-3</m>, <m>x=-1</m>, <m>x=1</m>, and <m>x=4</m>.
                    Polynomials have no discontinuities, so these are the only possible end-points.
                    Using a number line broken at these points, we find <em>five</em> test intervals: <m>(-\infty,-3)</m>, <m>(-3,-1)</m>, <m>(-1,1)</m>, <m>(1,4)</m>, <m>(4,\infty)</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will test each interval by choosing a single value and calculating the sign of the formula.
                    Because the formula is factored, this can be quickly determined by keeping track of the signs of each factor and then counting the number of negative factors.
                    An odd number of negative factors will result in a negative product.
                    An even number of negative factors will result in a positive product.

                    We create a number line and mark each of the possible end-points by solving the equation.
                    Label the value of the variable below the line and why it was included above the line (either a root or discontinuity).
                    Then for each resulting interval choose a test point (label below the interval) and write the sign of the formula above the line.

                    After we complete the sign analysis, we need to <em>interpret</em> our results.
                    In this question, we were solving for where <m>x^4-x^3-13x^2+x+12</m> was <em>less than</em> zero, meaning it was <em>negative</em>.
                    We select the set of all values on our number linear that created negative values for the formula.
                    Our solution set is <m>(-3,-1) \cup (1,4)</m>.

            We should think of sign analysis and the interpretation as separate steps.
            The previous example involved an inequality with strict inequality.
            At the end-points, the value of the formula was equal to zero.
            This is why they were not included in the intervals.
            If the problem had involved an inequality <m>\le</m> (less than <em>or equal</em>), then each point we found that made the formula equal to zero would also have been included.
            The sign analysis would be the same; only the interpretation would be different.

            <term>Rational functions</term> are quotients of polynomials.
            Because division by zero is undefined, discontinuities will happen at each point where the denominator has a value of zero.
            We can do sign analysis for rational functions just like we do for polynomials, so long as we worry about both roots and discontinuities.

                <p>
                    The inequality is already written as a relation with zero.
                    We need to find where the numerator equals zero (root of formula) and where the denominator equals zero (discontinuity of formula).
                    These can be found by factoring the two polynomials.
                    As they are both have degrees greater than 2, we will rely on computer assistance.

                    We can now rewrite our inequality in factored form:
                    <me>\frac{x(x+2)(x-1)^2}{(x^2-2)(x+5)} \ge 0</me>.
                    The factors in the numerator result in zeros at <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=-2</m>, and <m>x=1</m>.
                    Notice that one factor in the denominator <m>x^2-2</m> is still quadratic and will have two zeros.
                    Using isolation, we find <m>x=\pm\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>x=-5</m> as the three discontinuities for our quotient.

                <p>
                    We put these six numbers on the number line and it creates seven test intervals.
                    Note that we need to make a distinction between the roots (making the formula equal zero) and the discontinuities (making the formula undefined).

                    Looking at the number line and recognizing that <m>\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414</m>, we might choose test points with the set <m>\{-6, -3, -1.5, -1, 0.5, 1.2, 2\}</m>.
                    Notice how some of our test points are forced to be non-integers.
                    For each of these <m>x</m>-values, we look at the formula
                    <me>\frac{x(x+2)(x-1)^2}{(x^2-2)(x+5)}</me>
                    and count how many factors will be negative.
                    Note that <m>(x-1)^2</m> is technically two factors <m>(x-1)(x-1)</m>, and so overall will always positive except when <m>x=1</m>.
