    <title>Linear Relations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Calculus is focused on how variables covary or change <em>with</em> one another.
            Ultimately, we will want to describe this change through the language of functions.
            However, as we get started, it is easiest to think of a simple relation between two variables represented by an equation.
            The most basic relation represented by an equation is a <term>linear relation</term>.

            What is a line? In common language, we might think of a line as something that we can draw with a pen. Mathematics requires a more precise definition and is motivated from geometry by the idea of a straight edge graph joining two points.
            In mathematics, lines <em>are</em> straight. Anything else would be a <term>curve</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, now we have a <em>geometric</em> way of thinking about a line<mdash/>it is a straight edge you can form joining two points.
            We would like an <em>algebraic</em> way of thinking about a line so that we can use formulas.
            To connect the geometric and algebraic concepts, we need to think about locations of points in terms of <term>coordinates</term> on a <term>Cartesian plane</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Points on a plane can be identified by knowing the horizontal and the vertical displacements from an origin.
            These displacements correspond to two variables.
            When mathematics is disconnected from physical applications, these variables are most commonly called <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
            In applications, the variables more commonly are assigned to names that have some physical significance.
            For example, we might use <m>t</m> for time, <m>v</m> for velocity, or <m>F</m> for force.

            A line, like any other curve, includes infinitely many points.
            What is it about a line that distinguishes it from other curves?
            Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that lines have a <em>constant</em> <term>rate of change</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand the concept of rate of change, we need to consider the relationship between two different points, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, from the same graph.
            If our variables are <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then we might represent one point as having coordinates <m>A=(x_1,y_1)</m> and the second point as having coordinates <m>B=(x_2,y_2)</m>.
            We calculate how the variables change going <em>from</em> <m>A</m> <em>to</em> <m>B</m>:
            <md>
                <mrow>\Delta x = x_2 - x_1</mrow>,
                <mrow>\Delta y = y_2 - y_1</mrow>.
            </md>
            Note that we think of <m>\Delta x</m> as the name of a <em>single</em> quantity.
            The order of subtraction is chosen so that we can legitimately say <m>x_2 = x_1 + \Delta x</m> and <m>y_2 = y_1 + \Delta y</m>.
            We call <m>\Delta x</m> the <term>increment of change</term> in <m>x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m> the <term>increment of change</term> in <m>y</m> as we go from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="defn_average_rate_of_change_variables">
            <title>Average Rate of Change</title>
            <statement>
                For <em>any</em> relation between variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> joining two points <m>A=(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>B=(x_2,y_2)</m>, the <term>average rate of change</term> of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is defined as the ratio <m>\Delta y / \Delta x</m>,
                <me>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</me>.
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            For a line, the increments of change are <em>proportional</em> to one another.
            Equivalently, a line has the same average rate of change between any two points.
            That is, there is a <em>constant</em>, usually designated by <m>m</m>, such that for any two points on the line, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the increments of change are related by
            <me>\Delta y = m \cdot \Delta x \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = m</me>.
            For a line, this constant rate of change is called the <term>slope</term> of the line.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic skill related to calculating and using a slope is to identify the two points and calculate the ratio of the change in the dependent variable (<m>y</m>) to the change in the independent variable (<m>x</m>).
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_slope_simple_calculate">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Calculate the slope of the line joining the points <m>(x,y)=(1.8,5)</m> and <m>(x,y)=(3.2, -2)</m>.

                    Rather than jump right into the calculation, it is better to think about what we expect so that we can see if our calculated answer makes sense.
                    In this case, a visualization of what we are calculating is helpful.
                    We can do this by graphing the two points (or at least thinking about the graph).

                <p>
                    Notice how the point <m>(3.2,-2)</m> is to the right of and below the first point <m>(1.8,5)</m>.
                    We say that the graph of the line is <em>decreasing</em>.
                    This corresponds to a slope that is <em>negative</em>.
                    When we complete our calculation, we want to be sure that we get a negative slope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we calculate the slope, it is possible to do it in a single step.
                    Again, it can be helpful to think about it more deliberately by calculating the increments <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m> separately.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\Delta x &amp;= x_2 - x_1 = 3.2 - 1.8 = 1.4</mrow>
                        <mrow>\Delta y &amp;= y_2 - y_1 = -2 - 5 = -7</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Notice how the definition we are following expects that we have identified what we mean by <em>first</em> and <em>second</em> point.
                    We need to be careful that we calculate both increments as the change going <em>from</em> the first <em>to</em> the second point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do the values make sense?
                    The increment <m>\Delta x</m> is <em>positive</em> because the second point is <em>to the right of</em> the first point.
                    The increment <m>\Delta y</m> is <em>negative</em> because the second point is <em>below</em> the first point.
                    So we have verified that the <em>signs</em> of the increments are consistent with what we observed in the graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The value of the slope (rate of change) can now be directly calculated as the ratio of the increments of change,
                    <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-7}{1.4} = -5</me>.
                    The slope is negative as we expected.

            More thought is required when the points are not identified so clearly
            or when you need to identify which variable is independent and which is dependent.

                    Foresters are interested in the relationship between the trunk thickness (DBH=diameter at breast height) and total biomass of a species of tree in order to understand the carbon content in forests.
                    (See <url href="https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_rp591.pdf" visual="https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_rp591.pdf">USDA Research Paper PNW-RP-591</url>.)
                    A stand of Douglas-fir in the Pacific Northwest was sampled and trees with a trunk diameter of 12 cm had an average biomass of 38 kg,
                    while trees with a trunk diameter of 14 cm had an average biomass of 56 kg.
                    Find the average rate of change of the biomass with respect to the trunk diameter based on this data, including proper use of units.

                    How do we approach this type of question?
                    Instead of being given two points, we are given a text description of some data.
                    We don't even know what the variables are.
                    A useful strategy for solution is to read the problem to identify what is wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The example asks us to <q><em>Find</em> the average rate of change of the biomass with respect to the trunk diameter</q>.
                    The key phrase <em>with respect to</em> helps us identify what are being consider the independent and dependent variables.
                    The main quantity of interest is the <em>biomass</em> and that will be the <em>dependent</em> variable (<m>y</m>-like).
                    The quantity identified <em>after</em> the phrase <em>with respect to</em> is the <em>independent variable</em>.
                    That is, we think of the independent variable as <em>controlling</em> or <em>influencing</em> the dependent variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To visualize the data, we could graph two points.
                    If it is not clear what points we should use, it can be useful to first make a table from the data and then identify the points.
                    We will create a table with columns for the trunk diameter and the tree biomass.
                    For consistency in our identification of the independent and dependent variables, it might be useful to list the diameter first and the biomass second.
                    The rows of the table correspond to paired observations.
                    That is, trees with 12 cm diameter at breast height are the same trees that had an average biomass of 38 kg.

                    Next, for scientific communication, it is better to use variable names that have a connection to the data they represent than always using <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
                    For this data set, we might choose <m>D</m> as our variable representing the <em>diameter</em> of the trees and <m>M</m> as our variable representing the total biomass.
                    Consequently, our data correspond to two points:
                    <m>(D,M)=(12,38)</m> and <m>(D,M)=(14,56)</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physical measurements are always associated with a unit scale.
                    That is, it doesn't make sense to a length measured 4;
                    we need to say the unit used in the measurement.
                    Notice that <m>D</m> has associated units of cm (a length) while <m>M</m> has units of kg (a mass).
                    The increments of change between the two points are
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\Delta D &amp;= D_2 - D_1 = 14-12 = 2 \, \text{cm}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\Delta M &amp;= M_2 - M_1 = 56-38 = 18 \, \text{kg}</mrow>.
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The average rate of change is the slope of the line joining these points.
                    The units of rate of change is the ratio of the units of the corresponding variables.
                    The average rate of change of <em>biomass</em> with respect to <em>trunk diameter</em> will therefore have units of kg/cm.
                    The value is calculated as
                    <me>\frac{\Delta M}{\Delta D} = \frac{18 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{cm}} = 9 \, \text{kg/cm}</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does this make sense?
                    The increments are both positive.
                    Changing from the first point <m>(D,M)=(12,38)</m> to <m>(D,M)=(14,56)</m>, both the diameter and the biomass increased.
                    This corresponds to both increments being positive and the resulting slope being a positive number.
                    A graph of the points reinforces this, showing that the line would have a positive slope.

            An equation involving two variables defines a <term>relation</term> between those variables.
            Values for the variables that would make the equation <em>true</em> correspond to points that would be included in the graph.

        <p>
            A line provides a simple example to illustrate this idea as well as provides one of the most basic examples of a relation that is a function.
            Consider the equation
            <me>3x+2y=12</me>.
            As written, the statement is not true or false because we have left <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as variables.
            The truth of the statement is waiting for specific values.
        </p>
        <p>
            But now consider a particular point, say <m>(x,y)=(2,3)</m>.
            In the context of that point, we will use <m>x=2</m> and <m>y=3</m>.
            The expression <m>3x+2y</m> now has a specific value,
            <me>3x+2y = 3(2)+2(3) = 12</me>,
            so that <m>3x+2y=12</m> is a true statement.
            This means that the point <m>(2,3)</m> is <em>in</em> the relation defined by the equation and therefore a point on its graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, another point <m>(x,y)=(3,2)</m> assigns different values to the variables.
            For this point, the expression <m>3x+2y = 3(3)+2(2)=13</m>.
            The relation's equation <m>3x+2y = 12</m> is <em>false</em> for this point.
            The point is <em>not</em> in the relation and will be <em>off</em> the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph of <m>3x+2y=12</m> happens to be a line.
            Two other points on this line are <m>(x,y)=(4,0)</m> and <m>(x,y)=(0,6)</m>.
            (Can you verify this?)

            In the discussion above, we started with an equation and were basically just randomly picking points and testing if they were or were not in the graph of the equation.
            One important skill is to be able to <em>create</em> an equation that represents a relation that we want.
            A second important skill is to be able to <em>visualize</em> the graph of an equation without necessarily trying a lot of different points.
            Here we will focus on how to <em>create</em> an equation for a line when we know the slope and one point.
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of slope can be used to create an equation of a line.
            If we know one point <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m> (think of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as placeholders for that knowledge), then for <em>any other</em> point <m>(x,y)=(x_2,y_2)</m>, we know that
            <me>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2-b}{x_2-a} = m</me>.
            Equivalently, this means <m>\Delta y = m \cdot \Delta x</m> or
            <me>y_2 - b = m \cdot(x_2 - a)</me>.
            The subscripts on <m>x_2</m> and <m>y_2</m> were meant to indicate we were thinking about some specific point.
        </p>
        <p>
            More probably, we want to think about <em>arbitrary</em> points, so we will drop the subscripts and think about the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directly.
            An equation for the line passing through <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m> and having a slope <m>m</m> is given by
            <me>y - b = m \cdot (x-a)</me>.
            This equation is called the point-slope equation of a line. We often rewrite the equation by isolating <m>y</m> as a <em>function</em> of <m>x</m>.

            You may be more familiar or comfortable with the equation of a line defined as <m>y=mx+b</m>, called the <em>slope-intercept</em> equation of a line.
            This is a special case of the point<ndash/>slope equation of a line where we know the slope <m>m</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept point <m>(0,b)</m>.
            However, knowing the <m>y</m>-intercept is uncommon in applications.
            Using the point<ndash/>slope equation allows us to write down the equation of a line without needing to go figure out a separate point.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_find_line_equation">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find an equation of the line passing through the point <m>(5,12)</m> with a slope <m>m=\frac{3}{2}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The point<ndash />slope form makes this very simple.
                    When we recall that <m>\Delta y = m \cdot \Delta x</m> and then think of <m>(5,12)</m> as our starting point and <m>(x,y)</m> as a second point, we get increments <m>\Delta y = y-12</m> and <m>\Delta x = x-5</m>.
                    The equation can then be immediately written
                    <me>y - 12 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot(x-5)</me>.
                    If we want to write <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, we isolate the <m>y</m> to get
                    <me>y = \frac{3}{2} \cdot(x-5) + 12</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compare what would happen if we tried to use the slope<ndash />intercept form <m>y=mx+b</m>.
                    We know from the problem <m>m=\frac{3}{2}</m> but we do not yet know the intercept value <m>b</m>.
                    We might make use of the information that we do know to get
                    <me>y=\frac{3}{2} x + b</me>.
                    To find <m>b</m>, we could use the information that we know <m>(x,y)=(5,12)</m> is a point on the line.
                    That is, substituting values <m>x=5</m> and <m>y=12</m> must create a true equation:
                    <me>12 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 5 + b</me>.
                    We can now solve for <m>b</m>:
                    <me>b = 12 - \frac{15}{2} = \frac{24-15}{2} = \frac{9}{2}</me>.
                    Now that we know the value of the intercept, we can finish the equation,
                    <me>y = \frac{3}{2} x + \frac{9}{2}</me>.
                    This second method is completely valid but requires extra work.
                    Also, students often find the value of <m>b</m> but then forget to use it to finish stating the equation that was requested.

        </example>
        <p>
            In the previous example, we saw how the point<ndash />slope equation of a line is an efficient way to find the equation of a line.
            More importantly, as we are preparing for calculus, this form of a line illustrates a core idea that we will be studying: the relationships between <em>increments</em> of change and <em>rates</em> of change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as variables and think of the slope <m>m</m> as defining the constant rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
            Knowing a point <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m> corresponds to know that <m>y=b</m> when <m>x=a</m>.
            The point<ndash />slope equation of a line tells us that if we <em>change</em> <m>x</m> by an increment <m>\Delta x</m> to <m>x=a+\Delta x</m>, then the dependent variable <m>y</m> must also change but with an increment <m>\Delta y = m \cdot \Delta x</m> to <m>y = b + \Delta y = b + m \cdot \Delta x</m>.

        <example xml:id="ex_using_point_slope">
            <title>Learning Outcome P-2</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    In our earlier example, we learned that the total biomass of a Douglas-fir is related to the diameter at breast height of the trunk. When the diameter is 12 cm, the average total biomass was 38 kg. The biomass increased at a rate of 9 kg per cm with respect to the diameter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Estimate the total biomass of a Douglas-fir tree whose diameter at breast height is 12.8 cm.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    First, we identify our variables.
                    As in our earlier example, we will let <m>M</m> be the total biomass (kg) and will let <m>D</m> be the trunk diameter (cm).
                    The <em>known</em> point is the given information <m>M=38 \, \text{kg}</m> and <m>D=12 \, \text{cm}</m>.
                    The phrase <q>increased at a rate</q> identifies the value <m>9 \, \text{kg/cm}</m> as the rate of change. The word <em>increased</em> indicates that this is a positive value. (To say a quantity decreases would mean it has a negative rate of change.)
                    The phrase <q>with respect to the diameter</q> lets us know that we are thinking of <m>D</m> as being the independent variable (<m>x</m>-like).
                    This is reinforced by the units of the rate being <em>kg per cm</em> so that the <m>y</m>-variable is measured in kg and the <m>x</m>-variable is measured in cm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can immediately write down our model equation,
                    <me>M-38 = 9 \cdot (D-12)</me>,
                    which becomes
                    <me>M = 38 + 9 \cdot (D-12)</me>.
                    Can you see how we can view the biomass formula as <m>M = 38 + \Delta M</m>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have our model equation, we can <em>substitute</em> the new value of <m>D = 12.8 \, \text{cm}</m> into our equation,
                    <me>M = 38 + 9 \cdot (12.8 - 12)</me>.
                    Can you see how <m>\Delta D = 0.8 \, \text{cm}</m> is the increment of change of the diameter and how that will lead to <m>\Delta M = 9 \cdot 0.8 = 7.2 \, \text{kg}</m>?
                    Consequently, our model predicts <m>M = 38 + 7.2 = 45.2 \, \text{kg}</m>.
                    We predict the biomass of the tree will be 45.2 kg.
