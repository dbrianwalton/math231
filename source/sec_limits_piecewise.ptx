    <title>Limits with Simple Formulas</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            For most students, their experience with functions is that graphs are always continuous.
            Or at least if they are discontinuous, there is a definite reason like a vertical asymptote.
            That is because all algebraic functions <em>are</em> continuous, at least at the points in their domains.
            This is not an obvious fact, and it requires additional mathematical tools to show it is true, some of which we will learn.
            For this section, we will take as an article of faith (that needs to be justified later) the following statement.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm_algebraic_continuous_on_domain">
            <title>Continuity of Algebraic Functions</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function defined algebraically, so that it only involves operations of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and powers (including roots).
                    Let <m>x=a</m> be a value in the domain of <m>f</m>.
                    If there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> so that <m>(a-\delta,a+\delta)</m> is a subset of the domain of <m>f</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is, if <m>f(x)</m> is defined for values immediately to the left and to the right of <m>x=a</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            The consequence of this theorem is that when we are calculating limits when we know the formula,
            we really only need to calculate the function value as long as that value exists.
            If the value of the formula does <em>not</em> exist, then the theorem is silent and does not say how we would calculate the limit.
            We will learn <em>some</em> strategies for dealing with that case in the next section.
            In this section, we will use the power of continuity of individual formulas to explore limits and continuity of functions that are defined piecewise.

        <title>Limits of Piecewise Functions</title>
        <p>
            A piecewise defined function gives different rules or formulas for a function on different restrictions to the domain.
            A limit looks at the values to the left or to the right of a given point and sees what they approach.
            Putting these two ideas together, we can evaluate a limit of a piecewise defined function where each formula is itself algebraic by:
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Identifying which restricted domain applies for values to the left or right of the point (based on left or right limit). 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Attempting to evaluate the corresponding algebraic formula to see if it has a value.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    If the value exists, by continuity <em>of the formula</em>, it must be the same as the desired limit. If the value does not exist (not continuous), we need more tools to determine what happens to the limit.

                    To find <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to -2} g(x)</m>, we need to look at the left-limit and the right-limit first.
                    Checking our restricted domains, we see that for <m>x \to -2</m> with <m>x \lt -2</m>, we will use <m>g(x)=2x+3</m> and write:
                    <me>\lim_{x \to -2^-} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} [2x+3]</me>.
                    That formula is algebraic and so the limit will use the value if it makes sense (continuity), so that we find
                    <me>\lim_{x \to -2^-} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} [2x+3] = 2(-2)+3 = -1</me>.
                    For <m>x \to -2</m> with <m>x \gt -2</m>, we see we need to use <m>g(x)=1-x</m>, which is also algebraic and continuous when defined:
                    <me>\lim_{x \to -2^+} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+}[1-x] = 1-(-2) = 3</me>.
                    At this point, we compare those answers and see that they are not equal, and the two-sided limit does not exist:
                    <me>\lim_{x \to -2} g(x) \; \text{d.n.e.}</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1} g(x)</m>, we again need to look at the left- and right-limits.
                    On the left, using the restricted domains and continuity of algebraic formulas, we have
                    <me>\lim_{x \to 1^-} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^-}[1-x] = 1-1 = 0</me>.
                    On the right, we similarly find
                    <me>\lim_{x \to 1^+} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^+}[x^2-1] = (1)^2-1 = 0</me>.
                    This time, the left- and right-limits agree, so the two-sided limit exists,
                    <me>\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 0</me>,
                    but this limit has no direct relation to a formula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} g(x)</m>, we find that <m>x=2</m> is inside the restricted domain <m>(1,\infty)</m>.
                    Both the left- and right-limits are going to involve the same algebraic formula and by continuity.
                    As long as the value makes sense, both sides use the same calculation:
                    <me>\lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 2}[x^2-1] = 2^2 - 1 = 3</me>.

            Although individual algebraic formulas are continuous, when they are combined in a piecewise defined function, the continuity of the combined function requires verifying whether the definition of continuity is satisfied.
            Recall that this involves:
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Make sure the limit exists (both sides) and find its value.

                <li><p>
                    Make sure the function value exists (single point) and find its value.

                    We previously found
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\lim_{x \to -2^-} g(x) = -1</mrow>,

                    </md>
                    from which we decided that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to -2} g(x)</m> does not exist.
                    Furthermore, <m>g(-2)</m> itself also does not exist since <m>x=-2</m> is not in any of the restricted domains.
                    Since both values fail to exist, they can not be equal.
                    <m>g</m> is <em>not</em> continuous at <m>x=-2</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also previously found

                        <mrow>\lim_{x \to 1^-} g(x) = 0</mrow>,

                    </md>
                    As these have the same value, we know <m>\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 0</m>.
                    Looking at the restricted domains, we find that <m>x=1</m> is in the domain <m>(-2,1]</m> so that <m>g(1)</m> will use the formula <m>g(x)=1-x</m> to give <m>g(1)=1-1=0</m>.
                    Because <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1}g(x) = g(1)</m>, we have verified that <m>g(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=1</m>.

        <p>
            Remember that getting the left- and right-limits to agree is what is necessary for the two-sided limit to have a value but is <em>not</em> enough to show continuity.
            Continuity requires also showing that the function's value matches the same thing.
            Otherwise (the limit exists but does <em>not</em> match the function), the function has a <term>removable discontinuity</term>.
            It gets this name because if we <em>modified</em> the function at a single point in the domain, we could change it to continuous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any time the left- and right-limits both have values but are different, the function has a <term>jump discontinuity</term>,
            regardless of whether the function is defined at the point of interest.
            A jump discontinuity can not be made continuous by changing a single point.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are other types of discontinuities.
            When limits are infinite (see later), the function has an <term>infinite discontinuity</term>.
            When left- or right-limits just don't exist at all because the values just don't approach any single value, the function has an <term>essential discontinuity</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing this terminology can help in communication but is not part of learning objectives.
