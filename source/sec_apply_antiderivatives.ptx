    <title>Antiderivatives</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Having learned that so much of a function's behavior can be described by knowing the derivative (and subsequently the second derivative), it is hopefully not too surprising to learn that knowing the derivative alone can be used to characterize almost all of the function.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the major themes in mathematics is the idea of <term>inverse operations</term>. When we start with a function <m>g(x)</m> and use it to find the derivative <m>g'(x)</m>, this action <m>\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)] = g'(x)</m> is called <term>differentiation</term>. We can <em>almost</em> do the action in reverse. That, is starting with a function <m>f(x)</m>, the action used to find a function <m>F(x)</m> so that our function <m>f(x)</m> is the derivative of <m>F(x)</m> is called <term>antidifferentiation</term> and we say that <m>F(x)</m> is an <term>antiderivative</term> of <m>f(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have two learning outcomes connected to this idea.

        <title>Overview of Antiderivatives</title>
        <p>
            When we learned about inverse functions, we learned that inverse functions <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> have the property that the input/output pairing change places:
            <me>f(x)=y \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad f^{-1}(y) = x</me>.
            If we think of the differentiation operator in a similar way, a function <m>f(x)</m> and its derivative <m>f'(x)</m> can be interpreted as an input/output pair:
            <me>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] = f'(x)</me>.
            The original function <m>f(x)</m> is the input to the operator and its derivative is the output.
            An inverse to differentiation should therefore reverse the ordering between these:
            <me>\frac{d}{dx}^{-1}[f'(x)] = f(x)</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, differentiation is not one-to-one and so can not have a true inverse.
            For example, consider <m>f(x) = x^4 - 3x^2 + 4</m> and <m>g(x)=x^4 - 3x^2 - \pi</m>.
            Because the formulas involving <m>x</m> are the same and the derivative of every constant is zero, we have both functions creating the same derivatives, <m>f'(x)=g'(x)</m>
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}[x^4-3x^2+4] = 4x^3-6x</mrow>,
                <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}[x^4-3x^2-\pi] = 4x^3-6x</mrow>.
            </md>
            So if we asked to find <em>the</em> antiderivative of <m>4x^3-6x</m>, we know at least two possible answers and quickly realize that there are infinitely many possible answers
            <me>\frac{d}{dx}^{-1}[4x^3-6x] = x^4-3x^2+C</me>,
            where <m>C</m> could be <em>any</em> constant you might choose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe there are others as well that are not just adding a different constant. A natural question arises: Are there <em>other</em> functions that <em>also</em> have the same derivative?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mean Value Theorem comes to our rescue and tells us, no. The only antiderivatives that are possible are those that differ by a constant.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm_antiderivative_differ_by_constant">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> have the same derivative, <m>f'(x)=g'(x)</m> on an interval <m>I</m>. Then there must be a constant <m>C</m> so that <m>g(x)-f(x)=C</m>, or equivalently <m>g(x)=f(x)+C</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    Define the function measuring the difference between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>,
                    <me>D(x) = g(x)-f(x)</me>.
                    On the interval <m>I</m>, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable and have the same derivative values, so that we have
                    <me>D'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[g(x)-f(x)] = g'(x)-f'(x) = 0</me>.
                    The <xref ref="thm_first_deriv_monotonicity">first derivative test for monotonicity</xref>, which was an immediate consequence of the Mean Value Theorem, proved that when a function has a derivative equal to zero on an interval, that function must be a constant on that interval, <m>D(x)=C</m> for some constant <m>C</m>. That is <m>g(x)-f(x)=C</m> or <m>g(x)=f(x)+C</m>.
                </p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            If we can find <em>one</em> antiderivative, then all other antiderivatives can be found by adding a constant. Graphically, this means that antiderivatives are vertical translations (shifts) of one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in calculus, we will learn that, at least for continuous functions, antiderivatives can always be computed through a process called <term>integration</term>.
            This fact is the central pillar of calculus called the <term>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</term>. For this reason, rather than using a notation like <m>\frac{d}{dx}^{-1}</m> for finding antiderivatives, the notation instead adopts what is called an <term>indefinite integral</term>:
            <me>\int f(x) \, dx \equiv \frac{d}{dx}^{-1}[f(x)]</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way to think about the integral notation is to remember that a derivative is calculated as a limit of a difference quotient, meaning we find the difference <m>f(x+h)-f(x)</m> and calculate the quotient of this divided by <m>\Delta x = h</m>. In the limit, we think of <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \to \frac{dy}{dx}</m>. The inverse operation must involve something like a limit of a product sum. The integral sign <m>\int</m> is an elongated S representing a sum and the product of <m>f(x)</m> with <m>dx</m> is the product. When integration is formally introduced, you will indeed learn that it is defined by calculating a sum of terms calculated as a product of a function value times <m>\Delta x</m>, with a limit <m>\Delta x \to dx = 0</m>.

        <title>Graphing an Antiderivative</title>
        <p>
            The behavior of a function is characterized by its derivative.
            Consequently, if we know <m>f'(x)</m>, we can graph <m>y=f(x)</m> without knowing the actual function <m>f(x)</m> itself.
            <m>f(x)</m> will be an antiderivative of <m>f'(x)</m>, which means that we don't know an initial value of <m>f(x)</m> and that any graph we create could be shifted vertically up or down to get other antiderivatives.
            In addition, we currently only know where a function is increasing or decreasing, not <em>how much</em> it actual increases or decreases.
            When we learn about integration, we will learn that we need to calculate areas from the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> to get this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the process that we will follow:
            <ul>
                <li><p>Using the formula or graph of <m>f'(x)</m>, complete sign analysis of <m>f'(x)</m> to determine intervals on which <m>f(x)</m> is increasing or decreasing.</p></li>
                <li><p>(Future) Using integrals, compute the areas of regions of the graph <m>f'(x)</m> that are positive and negative to determine how much <m>f(x)</m> will increase or decrease on these intervals.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> or the formula of <m>f''(x)</m>, complete sign analysis of <m>f''(x)</m> to determine intervals on which <m>f(x)</m> is concave up or concave down.</p></li>
                <li><p>Determine the shape behavior from the sign analysis.</p></li>
                <li><p>Sketch a continuous graph of <m>f(x)</m>.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            When we only see a graph of <m>f'(x)</m>, the sign analysis of <m>f'(x)</m> is based on where the graph is above or below the <m>x</m>-axis. Because <m>f''(x)</m> is the derivative of <m>f'(x)</m>, the sign analysis of <m>f''(x)</m> is based on the sign of the <em>slope</em> of the graph of <m>f'(x)</m>. Where <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing, we will find <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m> and where <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing, we will find <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m>.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    We start by using the information about <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>f''(x)</m> to understand where <m>f(x)</m> is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signs of <m>f'(x)</m> determine the intervals of monotonicity.
                    The signs of <m>f'(x)</m> come from intervals where the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> is above or below the <m>x</m>-axis.
                    We see that <m>f'(x)=0</m> at <m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=2</m>.
                    Further, we see that <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> on <m>(-2,0)</m> and on <m>(2,\infty)</m>, while <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> on <m>(-\infty,-2)</m> and <m>(0,2)</m>.
                    This means that <m>f(x)</m> will be <em>decreasing</em> on <m>(-\infty,-2]</m>, increasing on <m>[-2,0]</m>, decreasing on <m>[0,2]</m>, and increasing on <m>[2,\inty)</m>.
                    Seeing that <m>f'(x) \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>, we realize that <m>f(x)</m> will become more and more horizontal on its ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first derivative also allows us to identify where <m>f(x)</m> has its local minimum and maximum values.
                    Because <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing on <m>(-\infty,-2]</m> and then increasing on <m>[-2,0]</m>, the graph falls and then rises, meaning that <m>f(x)</m> has a <em>local minimum</em> at <m>x=-2</m>.
                    By similar reasoning, we conclue that <m>f(x)</m> has a <em>local maximum</em> at <m>x=0</m> and another local minimum at <m>x=2</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signs of <m>f''(x)</m> determine the intervals of concavity.
                    Because <m>f''(x)</m> measures the rate of change of <m>f'(x)</m>, we will determine the signs of <m>f''(x)</m> by looking at the <em>slope</em> of <m>f'(x)</m>.
                    We start by finding <m>f''(x)=0</m>, where the tangent line of <m>f'(x)</m> is horizontal, which occurs at <m>x \approx -2.9</m>, <m>x \approx -0.9</m>, <m>x \approx 0.9</m>, and <m>x \approx 2.9</m>.
                    Because <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing on <m>(-\infty,-2.9)</m>, we can see that <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m> and so <m>f(x)</m> is concave down on <m>(-\infty, -2.9]</m>.
                    In a similar way, because <m>f'(x)</m> has positive slope for <m>-2.9 \lt x \lt -0.9</m>, we know <m>f(x)</m> is concave up on <m>[-2.9,-0.9]</m>.
                    Using the same reasoning on the remaining intervals, we learn that <m>f(x)</m> is concave down on <m>[-0.9,0.9]</m>, concave up on <m>[0.9,2.9]</m>, and concave up on <m>[2.9,\infty)</m>.
                    The function <m>f(x)</m> has inflection points at <m>x=-2.9</m>, <m>x=-0.9</m>, <m>x=0.9</m>, and <m>x=2.9</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>, we use the same ideas as we used in <xref ref="subsec_fcn_shape"/>.
                    When we learn about definite integrals, we will learn how to compute how <em>much</em> a function increases or decreases based on the area between the graph <m>y=f'(x)</m> and <m>y=0</m>, so here we only focus on matching the monotonicity and concavity we have found.
                    In this case, the areas above and below the axis exactly match, so our graph has the same horizontal asymptote on the left as on the right.

        <title>Antiderivatives and the Power Rule</title>
        <p>
            Given a formula for a function <m>f(x)</m>, can we find a formula for an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m>, a function so that <m>F'(x)=f(x)</m>?
            Unfortunately, the answer is <em>only sometimes</em>.
            The rules of differentiation mean that formulas of derivatives need to have patterns that can be created by following these rules.
            It is actually a challenging task, and often not even possible, to find such a formula.
        </p>
        <p>
            Polynomials, however, have the nice property that the derivative of a polynomial <em>is</em> another polynomial.
            In this special case, it is quite easy to find a formula of an antiderivative.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, recall the pattern of the power rule for a single power along with the constant multiple rule.
            We know
            <me>\frac{d}{dx}[c \cdot x^n] = (n \cdot c) \cdot x^{n-1}</me>.
            That is, the derivative will have a coefficient where the original coefficient is <em>multiplied</em> by the original power and the power will have been reduced by one. 
            If we want to find an <em>antiderivative</em>, we just need to invert this process: restore the power by adding one and then divide by that power.
            <me>\frac{d}{dx}^{-1}[a \cdot x^p] = (\frac{a}{p+1} \cdot x^{p+1}</me>.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_antideriv_power">
            <statement>

                    We will consider each power function at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first function <m>2x^3</m> has a power <m>p=3</m>.
                    For this to be the <em>derivative</em> of another function, the original power must have been <m>p+1=4</m>:
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[x^4] = 4x^3</me>.
                    Dividing by that original power 4, we find
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[{\textstyle \frac{1}{4}} x^4] = {\textstyle \frac{1}{4}} \cdot 4x^3 = x^3</me>.
                    To get the coefficient of 2, we multiply by 2.
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[2 \cdot {\textstyle \frac{1}{4}} x^4] = 2 x^3</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second function <m>5 \sqrt{x}</m> does not initially look like a power until we rewrite the square root <m>5 \sqrt{x} = 5 \cdot x^{1/2}</m>.
                    The power of the derivative is <m>p = \textstyle \frac{1}{2}</m>, so the power of the original function must have been <m>p+1 = \frac{3}{2}</m>:
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[x^{3/2}] = {\textstyle \frac{3}{2}} \cdot x^{1/2}</me>.
                    Dividing by the original power is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal to find
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[{\textstyle \frac{2}{3}} x^{3/2}] = {\textstyle \frac{2}{3}} \cdot {\textstyle \frac{3}{2}} \cdot x^{1/2} = x^{1/2}</me>.
                    We finish by multiplying by the coefficient:
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[{\textstyle 5 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} x^{3/2}] = 5 \cdot x^{1/2} = 5 \sqrt{5}</me>.
                    That is, an antiderivative of <m>5 \sqrt{x}</m> will be <m>\frac{10}{3} x^{3/2} = \frac{10}{3} x \sqrt x</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third function <m>\frac{3}{4x^4}</m> is also not immediately in the form of a power function.
                    We can not have division by a power, as we need to have it written as a constant <em>multiplying</em> by a power of <m>x</m>. 
                    So we rewrite using negative powers, <m>\frac{3}{4x^4} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot x^{-4}</m>.
                    The power in the derivative is <m>p=-4</m>, so the power in the antiderivative must be <m>p+1=-3</m>. In addition, following the pattern of the previous problems, we will need to <em>divide</em> by this power:
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{1}{-3} x^{-3}] = \frac{1}{-3} \cdot -3 x^{-4} = x^{-4}</me>.
                    To get the correct coefficient, we multiply by that constant:
                    <me>\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{-3} x^{-3}] = \frac{3}{4} x^{-4}</me>.
                    The basic antiderivative of <m>\frac{3}{4x^4}</m> would be <m>\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{-3} x^{-3} = \frac{-1}{4} x^{-3}</m>.

        <p>
            Because polynomials are just sums of simple power functions given by constants times powers of <m>x</m>, and derivatives have a sum rule, antiderivatives of polynomials and generalized polynomials can be found as a sum of the antiderivatives of each term.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the introduction of this section, we pointed out that an antiderivative also has an unknown constant that can be added.
            This constant allows us to apply a vertical shift or translation to the function.
            This allows us to match any single given point for the antiderivative we are seeking.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    For each problem, we will start by finding an antiderivative formula that is the sum of the basic antiderivatives of each simple power with an unknown added constant.
                    Then we will <em>evaluate</em> that function at the given point, which will create an equation involving that unknown constant.
                    Solving the equation, we will find the constant so that we can write down the function desired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recall that the notation for finding antiderivatives is with the integral operator <m>\int \ldots \, dx</m>,
                    so our first function will be
                    <me>f(x) = \int f'(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \int [x^3+2x-5] \, \mathrm{d}x</me>.
                    To use the antiderivative power rule, we need to think of <m>2x = 2x^1</m> and <m>-5 = -5 x^0</m>.
                    We find
                    <me>f(x) = {\textstyle \frac{1}{4}} x^4 + 2 \cdot {\textstyle \frac{1}{2}} x^2 - 5 \frac{1}{1} x^1 + C</me>,
                    where <m>C</m> represents the unknown constant.
                    Simplifying, we get
                    <me>f(x) = \textstyle \frac{1}{4}x^4 + x^2-5x+C</me>.
                    Note that it might be easier to recognize constants as having antiderivatives that are linear with the constant as its slope rather than using the power rule as illustratedabove.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this first example, we were given that <m>f(2)=5</m>.
                    Based on the function we just found, we can find a <em>formula</em> for that same value.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(2) &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 + (2)^2-5(2)+C</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(16) + 4 - 10 + C</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= -2 + C</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Knowing that <m>f(2)=5</m> and <m>f(2)=-2+C</m>, we create and then solve the equation <m>-2+C=5</m> to discover <m>C=7</m>.
                    The antiderivative in question was <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{4}x^4+x^2-5x+7</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second example, we had <m>f'(x) = x^2 - x \sqrt{x}</m>.
                    To find the general formula for antiderivatives, we need to rewrite this in the form of a generalized polynomial to get rid of the product and replace it by a single power,
                    <me>f'(x) = x^2 - x^{3/2}</me>.
                    The function <m>f(x)</m> will be one of the possible antiderivatives,
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(x) &amp;= \int [x^2 - x^{3/2}] \, \mathrm{d}x </mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{2}{5} x^{5/2} + C</mrow>.
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were also given <m>f(4)=1</m>, so we evaluate this general formula at <m>x=4</m> to create an equation so that we can find <m>C</m>.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(4) &amp;= \frac{1}{3} (4)^3 - \frac{2}{5} (4)^{5/2} + C</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= \frac{1}{3}\cdot 64 - \frac{2}{5} \cdot 32 + C</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= \frac{64}{3} - \frac{64}{5} + C</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= \frac{128}{15} + C</mrow>
                    </md>
                    This leads to an equation
                    <me>\frac{128}{15} + C = 1</me>
                    which we solve to find <m>C = \frac{-113}{15}</m>.
                    The specific antiderivative in question will be
                    <me>f(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{2}{5} x^{5/2} - \frac{113}{15}</me>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            As we wrap up this work, we need to be aware of one power that does not have a simple power function antiderivative.
            If we think about domain issues and the integration rule
            <me>\int x^p \, \mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{p+1} x^{p+1}</me>,
            we should recognize that division by <m>p+1</m> will have a problem if <m>p=-1</m>.
            Indeed, the special case of a power function <m>x^{p+1} = x^0</m> is constant and results in a derivative of 0 rather than a separate power.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will need an entirely new function to be the antiderivative of <m>x^{-1}</m>. We will later learn that this function is the natural logarithm, the transcendental function that is the inverse of the exponential function <m>\exp(x) = e^x</m>.
