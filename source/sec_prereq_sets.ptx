    <title>Sets and Interval Notation</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In typical algebra classes, sets are mainly used in describing solutions to equations or inequalities.
            This will still be true in calculus, but sets will play a more important role than just summarizing solutions.
            As we learn more about functions, we will learn that functions are defined in terms of sets.
            In addition, functions will also be described by various attributes (adjectives) that will be characterized by sets.
            In preparation, we will need to become practiced in describing and working with sets.

        <p>
            Sets are collections of objects from some universe of possibilities.
            In calculus, we primarily focus on sets of real numbers.
            A set can be a described by listing its members, when that is possible.
            If a set has a finite number of values (meaning the list has a specific number of values), then we can list the included values inside of curly braces, as in <m>\{2, 3, 5, 7\}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A set can be assigned a name, such as <m>P = \{2,3,5,7\}</m>.
            The number 2 is <em>in</em> <m>P</m>, which we write <m>2 \in P</m>.
            The number 4 is <em>not</em> in <m>P</m>, which we write <m>4 \not \in P</m>.
            A set that is <em>empty</em> would have no values, <m>\{\}</m>, and sometimes is written with a special symbol <m>\emptyset</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calculus is more interested in <term>intervals</term>.
            The real numbers form a <em>continuum</em> of values.
            Between any two real numbers, there is always another number (e.g., the midpoint).
            In fact, there are <em>infinitely many</em> numbers.
            Some of them are <term>rational numbers</term>, meaning a ratio of integers.
            There are also even more <term>irrational numbers</term>, numbers that can never be written as a ratio of integers.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    An interval is a set of real numbers consisting of all numbers between two end-points, possibly including the end-points.
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                <m>(a,b) = \{x : a \lt x \lt b\}</m> is called the <term>open interval</term> and excludes both end-points.

                                <m>[a,b] = \{x : a \le x \le b\}</m> is called the <term>closed interval</term> and includes both end-points.

                                <m>(a,b] = \{x : a \lt x \le b\}</m> is neither open nor closed because it excludes <m>a</m> and includes <m>b</m>.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            What are some important take-away messages about how intervals are defined?
        </p>
        <p>
            The end-points of the intervals always need to be ordered with the greater value listed second.
            So <m>(3,5)</m> is a valid interval but <m>(5,3)</m> is not.
            If an interval goes on forever, such as <m>x \gt 2</m>, we use infinity as an end-point, as in <m>(2,\infty)</m>.
            Similarly, <m>x \le -1</m> would create the interval <m>(-\infty,-1]</m>
            Be aware that infinity is <em>never</em> included as an end-point because it is not actually a real number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, a critical understanding requires recognizing that any non-empty interval has infinitely many different numbers inside.
            Learners often want to think only in terms of integer (whole-number) values, and this interferes with this understanding.
            For example, some learners want to think of <m>0 \lt x \lt 5</m> as only including integers <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> or think of <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m> as being empty (since there aren't any integers between 0 and 1).
            Be sure to think about fractional values.
            For example, <m>0.1 \in (0,1)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can visualize intervals and sets graphically by highlighting the points on a number line.
            Since the number line itself is a line, we often draw the interval or set as a thicker line over or next to the number line.
            Individual points are indicated with solid points.
            End-points that are not included are indicated with open circles or parentheses.
            It is also helpful to label the locations of the end-points, especially if the number line itself does not have the location clearly marked.
        </p>

            <title>Learning Outcome P-3</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Illustrate the intervals <m>(-4,-\pi]</m>, <m>[0,\sqrt{5})</m>, and <m>[\sqrt{2},\infty)</m>, and, for each interval, identify at least one non-integer real number that is in the interval.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    When thinking about numbers on the number line, it is useful to first identify their approximate decimal representation so that we can correctly find their position.
                    The value <m>\pi</m> has an approximate decimal representation of <m>\pi \approx 3.14159</m>.
                    When thinking about <m>-\pi</m>, we need to be careful that we put this <em>to the left</em> of -3 on the number line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the other non-integer values, we have <m>\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421</m> (rounds down) and <m>\sqrt{5} \approx 2.23607</m> (rounds up).
                    I made mention of rounding because this technically means that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is <em>between</em> 1.41421 and 1.41422, while <m>\sqrt{5}</m> is between 2.23606 and 2.23607.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we know where to place the numbers, we can draw our number line.
                    We really only need to include that part of the number line that is useful to illustrate our interval.
                    For example, the interval <m>(-4,-\pi]</m> might include a few integers to the left and right of the interval but does not need more than that.

                    What numbers are inside the interval? What numbers are outside?
                    You should be able to think about this critically.
                    Because <m>-\pi \approx -3.14159</m>, you should be able to reason
                    that <m>-\pi</m> is between -3.2 and -3.1.
                    Consequently, -3.2 is <em>inside</em> the interval but -3.1 is <em>outside</em> the interval.
                    Similarly, -3.15 is inside the interval while -3.14 is outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other two intervals are constructed similarly.
                    Be careful about end-points.
                    The value <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is <em>in</em> the interval <m>[\sqrt{2],\infty)</m> because the end-point is included.
                    However, if we used a decimal approximation <m>\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414</m>, the value 1.414 is <em>not</em> in the interval because this is rounding <em>down</em> from the exact value and so is to the left of the actual end-point.

        <p>
            Intervals and singletons (sets with a single value) form the elementary building blocks for more complicated sets.
            Suppose we were looking at the graph <m>y=x^2-1</m> and wanted to describe the set of values <m>x</m> so that the graph had <m>y \gt 0</m>.
            There are two <term>disjoint</term> pieces of the graph that have <m>y \gt 0</m>. One piece is where <m>x \lt -1</m> and the other is where <m>x \gt 1</m>.
            This is one set, but it is composed of <em>two</em> disjoint intervals.
            To make a statement about <m>x</m> being in the set, we would need to say <m>x \lt -1</m> <em>or</em> <m>x \gt 1</m>.
            Mathematically, we say that the set is a <term>union</term> of intervals and write <m>(-\infty,-1) \cup (1,\infty)</m>.

            A related concept to union is <term>intersection</term>.
            An intersection considers where sets <em>overlap</em> and includes <em>shared values</em> from the sets.

        <p>
            If we wanted to be careful, we would also need to learn that there is an order of set operations.
            Intersection is like multiplication and union is like addition.
            So if we had three sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, 
            the notation <m>A \cup B \cap C</m> would mean the union of <m>A</m> with <m>B \cap C</m>.
            To avoid worrying about this, we will use parentheses to make things clear.
            For that example, we would have an unambiguous notation by writing <m>A \cup (B \cap C)</m>, which is very different from <m>(A \cup B) \cap C</m>,
            the intersection of <m>A \cup B</m> with <m>C</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When working with sets defined by intervals, it can help greatly to put the sets side by side with a common number line.
            If you have access to color, that can help you keep track of the sets as well.
            We will see that if intervals overlap, the union will be a new interval that contains both parts.

                <p>
                    To find <m>A \cup B</m>, we need to describe the set of all values that are in <m>A</m> <em>or</em> <m>B</m>.
                    The two sets do not overlap at all, so the union will consist of the same disjoint intervals, but now combined as a single set,
                    <me>A \cup B = (-2,1] \cup [3,5)</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find <m>A \cup C</m>, we are interested in values that are in at least one of the sets.
                    Notice that these sets overlap, meaning there are some values that are in <em>both</em> intervals (in their intersection).
                    Consider the boundaries of this overlap.
                    We have <m>0 \in A</m> and <m>0 \not in C</m>, but it <em>is</em> in at least one set and so <m>0 \in A \cup C</m>.
                    Similarly, we have <m>1 \in A</m> and <m>1 \in C</m>.
                    By being in <em>both</em> sets, it is necessarily in at least one and so <m>1 \in A \cup C</m>.
                    All values between them are in both sets and so are in the union.
                    The union of these overlapping intervals will be a new interval that contains both,
                    <me>A \cup C = (-2,2]</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sets <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> do not overlap and so are disjoint.
                    The union is simply written
                    <me>B \cup C = (0,2] \cup [3,5)</me>.
                    Notice that the order of intervals in the union is reading the number line left-to-right, and does not match the order that <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> were listed in the union.
                    We could have written
                    <me>B \cup C = [3,5) \cup (0,2]</me>,
                    but this ordering is harder to transfer to a number line and so is not preferred.

        <p>
            To understand union and intersection and to reinforce the interpretation of individual intervals, you should be able to think through the union and intersection of compound sets.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_compound_set_operations">
            <title>Learning Outcome P-4</title>

                    Given the sets <m>A = (-\infty,-1] \cup (1,4]</m> and <m>B = [-1,1) \cup (3,5)</m>, find <m>A \cup B</m> and <m>A \cap B</m>, writing them as a union of disjoint sets.

                <p>
                    The solution follows the same patterns as our example involving individual intervals.
                    The major difference is that we are starting with compound sets.
                    When we graph our representations for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we will want to be clear that each set has multiple parts.

                    To find the union, we look for all values that are in <em>at least one</em> of the sets.
                    With the number line representations, we can scan from left to right.
                    The set <m>A</m> includes all values until -1, including that value;
                    the set <m>B</m> immediately begins, also including -1, and continuing until 1.
                    The union must include all of these values.
                    When we look at the value <m>1</m>, we see <m>1 \not in A</m> and <m>1 \not in B</m>, so <m>1 \not in A \cup B</m>.
                    But then <m>A</m> starts up immediately and includes all values until 4.
                    The set <m>B</m> includes all values from 3 until 5.
                    This overlap reduces to a single interval <m>(1,5)</m>.

                    The intersection of the sets looks for points that are in both sets.
                    We look at the original sets to see where they overlap.
                    Both sets include -1, but none of the values immediately to the left or right are in both sets.
                    This will be an isolated value in our intersection.
                    The value 1 might also look like it is in both sets, but in fact is in neither set.
                    The next set of values in the intersection is the interval from -3 to 4.
                    Because <m>-3 \not \in B</m>, it will not be in the intersection.
                    On the other hand, <m>4 \in A</m> and <m>4 \in B</m>, so it will be in the intersection.
