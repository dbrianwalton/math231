    <title>Function Notation</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Function notation provides a means to write about the value of a dependent variable given the value of the independent variable.
            Suppose we have a function <m>x \mapsto y</m> with a name of <m>f</m>, meaning that knowing the value of <m>x</m>, <m>f</m> allows us to determine the specific value of <m>y</m>.
            We would write <me>y=f(x)</me>.
            Function notation does not simply mean reading this as <q><m>y</m> is <em>a</em> function of <m>x</m></q>.
            Rather, this means that <m>f</m> provides <em>the rule</em> connecting the values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Function notation consists of using the name of the function followed immediately by a value or expression inside of parentheses.
            That value or expression represents the value of the independent variable in the relation.
            In algebra, a variable name followed by something inside of parentheses would mean there is an implicit (unstated) multiplication.
            However, for functions, this is not multiplication but mapping.
            The expression <m>f(2)</m> refers to <q>the output value of <m>f</m> when the input value is 2</q>, or more succinctly <q>the value of <m>f</m> at 2</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are related by an equation and we can solve that equation so that <m>y</m> is isolated, the formula on the other side is a formula representation of <m>f(x)</m>.
            So if we started with an equation <m>x^2+y=3</m>, this defines a relation.
            If we solve for <m>y</m> and get <m>y=3-x^2</m>, we realize that knowing <m>x</m> we can find <m>y</m> and so this equation defines a function.
            If we name the function <m>f</m>, then we have <m>f(x)=3-x^2</m>.
            We can then directly calculate the value of <m>y</m> by using the formula we find after substituting the variable <m>x</m> with its value.
            This means that <m>f(4)</m> represents <q>the value of <m>y</m> when <m>x=4</m></q> and using substitution we find
            <me>f(4) = 3-(4)^2 = 3-16 = -13</me>.
        </p>

            This section focuses on three learning goals that build on this core understanding.
            <ul>

                    Use function notation on a formula to evaluate and simplify an expression involving substitution with formulas.

        </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec_fcn_evaluation">
        <p>
            Function notation is often used to describe a summary of mathematical operations applied to a value.
            A function like <m>f(x)=x^2-3x</m> could be read as saying,
            <q>Given the input value, calculate its square and then subtract from it three times the input value</q>.
            If we then had <m>f(4)</m>, we would look at this and think, <q>The input is 4. So our rule says <m>f(4)</m> will have a value that is the square of 4 minus three times 4.</q>
            This is what we mean by <m>f(4) = 4^2 - 3(4)</m> to get <m>f(4)=16-12=4</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In applications, variables represent actual physical quantities.
            A function relating these variables will need to respect what <em>type</em> of value is used as the input and what type of value is created as an output.
            For example, if I were doing an electrophoresis gel observation with DNA, then there is a relation between the mass of a DNA segment and the distance it travels through the gel during the observation.
            If we let <m>M</m> be the mass of a segment and <m>D</m> be the distance traveled, then our observation would create a map <m>M \mapsto D</m>.
            If we said <m>D = f(M)</m>, then the function <m>f</m> is expecting <em>mass of a DNA fragment</em> as an input and gives a <em>distance</em> as output.
            It would not make any sense to talk about <m>f(M^2)</m> because <m>M^2</m> is no longer the mass of a fragment.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, in mathematics variables represent values in an abstract sense without including the units being measured.
            If we wrote <m>f(x^2)</m> for the same function described previously,
            we would think of <m>x</m> as a value so that <m>x^2</m> gives the mass of a DNA fragment.
            So mathematically, <m>f(x^2)</m> <em>can</em> make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            This idea perhaps feels weirder when we have a function defined in abstract, such as <m>f(x)=x^2-3x</m> and then write something like <m>f(2x+1)</m>.
            In one sense, it might feel like we are saying <m>x</m> <em>equals</em> <m>2x+1</m>.
            This is where it is helpful to think of <m>f</m> as the <em>rule</em> of what we <em>do</em> to the input (and not what we do to <m>x</m>).
            We need to <em>square</em> the input <m>(2x+1)</m> and then we need to subtract from that three times the input <m>(2x+1)</m>.
            <me>f(2x+1) = (2x+1)^2 - 3(2x+1)</me>.
            If we compare this to the original formula,
            <me>f(x) = x^2 - 3 x</me>,
            we can see that we are <em>substituting</em> the input formula <em>in place of</em> the input variable.
            Because the input formula represents a single value, we wrap it in parentheses as a group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we make the substitution, we are free to rewrite the formula in more convenient forms.
            For example, we might want to write the polynomial in standard form so that it is easier to combine with other polynomials later.
            <md>
                <mrow>f(2x+1) &amp;= (2x+1)^2 - 3(2x+1)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp;= (2x+1)(2x+1) - 3(2x+1)</mrow>

                <mrow>&amp;= 4x^2 - 2x - 2</mrow>
            </md>
            The <em>representations</em> of the function value are different but they always given the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are expected to be able to apply the principles of function evaluation using substitution in order to expand and then simplify combinations of functions evaluated with expressions as inputs.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex_function_evaluate_simplify">
            <title>Learning Objective F-1</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Given a function <m>f(x) = x^2 - 2x</m>,
                    Compute, expand, and simplify <m>f(2x) - f(x-3)</m>.

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    When thinking about a problem like this, I like to imagine blocks representing components of the formula.
                    I might write <m>\boxed{f(2x)} - \boxed{f(x-3)}</m>.
                    That is, I should recognize that there are two formulas I need to find, <m>f(2x)</m> and <m>f(x-3)</m>, and I will later subtract them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One method would be to find the individual formulas first using substitution.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(x) &amp;= x^2 - 2x</mrow>
                        <mrow>f(2x) &amp;= (2x)^2 - 2(2x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= (2x)(2x) - 2(2x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= 4x^2 - 4x</mrow>

                        <mrow>&amp;= x^2-8x+15</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Once we know the individual formulas, we combine them to create the value in question.
                    We need to be careful to think of these formulas as giving a single value, so we place them inside parentheses to treat the formula as a grouped expression:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(2x) - f(x-3) &amp;= (4x^2-4x) - (x^2-8x+15)</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= 4x^2-4x - x^2 + 8x - 15</mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp;= 3x^2 + 4x - 15</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An alternative method would be to do all of the substitution at once.
                    If this approach is used, extra caution must be taken to ensure that we treat all of the grouped expressions as single values.
                    Use parentheses carefully:

                        <mrow>f(2x) - f(x-3) &amp;= \Big((2x)^2-2(2x)\Big) - \Big((x-3)^2 - 2(x-3)\Big)</mrow>

        <p>
            Understanding the relation between the input and output values of a function are critical in understanding function notation.
            If <m>f</m> is a specified function and we are told for some value <m>x</m> that <m>f(x)=4</m>, we should recognize that the symbol <m>f(x)</m> represents the <em>output</em> value of the function for an input value of <m>x</m>.
            Saying that <m>f(x)=4</m> means <m>x</m> is a value for the input such that the output is 4.
            To apply this understanding to problems involving tables and graphs,
            we need to know how to interpret input/output pairings for each tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            A graph representing a function <m>f</m> includes points <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>f(a)=b</m>.
            That is, the <m>x</m>-value of a point on the graph is an <em>input</em> value.
            The <m>y</m>-value will be the corresponding <em>output</em> value.
            You should have previously learned that a function must satisfy the <term>vertical line test</term>, which means that for every specific value of <m>x</m> (a vertical line), there can be <em>at most</em> one point on the graph.
            Otherwise, knowing the value of the input would <em>not</em> allow us to know the value of the output.
            If there is no point on the graph for the given value of <m>x</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> will be undefined at that input.
        </p>
        <p>
            A table representing a function will typically give a column (or row) corresponding to the values of inputs and their corresponding outputs.
            If the heading to the column of inputs were <m>x</m>, then the column of outputs would be <m>f(x)</m>.

                <p>
                    To find <m>f(-2)</m>, we first interpret notation.
                    The symbol <m>f(-2)</m> stands for the <em>output</em> value of a function <m>f</m> with an input of <m>-2</m>.
                    That is, we want the <m>y</m>-value of the graph corresponding to the value <m>x=-2</m>.
                    The vertical line at <m>x=-2</m> passes through an open point at <m>(-2,1)</m> and a closed point at <m>(-2,-1)</m>.
                    The solid point is the point in the relation, so <m>f(-2) = -1</m>.
                    The open point represents a <em>limit</em> of the segment of the graph and not an actual point in the graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find <m>g(2)</m>, we again interpret notation.
                    The symbol <m>g(2)</m> is the output value of the map with input of <m>2</m>.
                    We look in the table of <m>g</m>.
                    The column headed by <m>x</m> contains input values while the column headed by <m>g(x)</m> contains corresponding output values.
                    Finding <m>x=2</m> in the first column is paired with <m>g(x)=-4</m> in the second column.
                    So <m>g(2)=-4</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find <m>x</m> so that <m>f(x)=g(0)</m>, we need to think through a few steps.
                    The symbol <m>g(0)</m> represents an output from <m>g</m> corresponding to an input of <m>0</m>.
                    Looking in the table with <m>x=0</m> we find <m>g(0)=1</m>.
                    We <em>replace</em> the symbol <m>g(0)</m> in the equation with this value to restate our question:
                    find <m>x</m> so that <m>f(x)=1</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that the value 1 and the symbol <m>f(x)</m> are equal, meaning that we are looking for value(s) <m>x</m> so that the <em>output</em> value <m>f(x)=1</m>.
                    We now look at the graph at a <m>y</m>-value (horizontal line) <m>y=1</m> and see what point(s) on the graph match.
                    There are three points where the graph's lines cross <m>y=1</m>,
                    at <m>x=-5</m>, <m>x=2</m>, and <m>x=4</m>.
                    The open point at <m>(-2,1)</m> is not an included point of the graph.

                <p>
                    To find <m>g(f(1))</m>, we need to think carefully about what this means.
                    A function name with parentheses means that whatever is inside the parentheses represents the input value.
                    Both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are functions here.
                    So what is the input?
                    The function <m>g</m> (outer function) has parentheses surrounding <m>f(1)</m>, so the value of <m>f(1)</m> is the input.
                    Because <m>f</m> is also a function, its parentheses indicate that <em>its</em> input is 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We start with the innermost piece to find <m>f(1)</m>.
                    An input <m>x=1</m> on the graph is matched with <m>y=3</m> (the closed point), so <m>f(1)=3</m>.
                    Once we know that value, we <em>substitute</em> to discover
                    <me>g(f(1)) = g(3)</me>.
                    The input <m>x=3</m> for the function <m>g</m> is paired with an output <m>g(x)=-3</m>, so <m>g(f(1))=-3</m>.

        <p>
            The <term>domain</term> of a function is the set of all valid <em>input</em> values.
            When we have a formula for a function, the domain is normally understood to be the set of all values for which the formula makes sense (output value is defined).
            We can <term>restrict</term> the domain of a function by specifying a specific set, usually by giving an interval for the valid input values.
            In this case, a function requires that we indicate both the formula and the interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            The notation for specifying a formula on a particular interval is to state the equation for the function's formula along with an inequality for the domain variable.
            If we want to use <m>f(x)=x^2</m> but use a domain <m>(0,3]</m>,
            we would write
            <me>f(x) = x^2, \quad 0 \lt x \le 3</me>.
            For this function, <m>f(0)</m> would not be defined because <m>x=3</m> is outside of the domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we are able to specify a specific formula on an interval in the domain, we can expand this idea to allow <em>different</em> formulas on different intervals.
            We call such functions <term>piecewise-defined</term>.
            The notation is to group the collection of rules on individual subsets of the domain with a curly brace on the left.
        </p>

            <statement>
                <p>

                    The domain has two subsets of interest.
                    On <m>[-2,0)</m>, the function uses <m>f(x)=3-x</m>;
                    on <m>(0,3]</m>, the function uses <m>f(x)=x^2</m>.
                    The overall domain is <m>[-2,0)\cup(0,3]</m>.
                    The value of <m>f(0)</m> is undefined because <m>x=0</m> is not in either domain restriction.

        <p>
            To evaluate a piecewise function at a point,
            the input value needs to be compared to the restricted domains.
            Whichever domain restriction the input value belongs determines which formula rule will be used.
            In the preceding example, to find <m>f(2)</m>, we look at the input <m>x=2</m> and recognize it belongs to the restriction <m>(0,3]</m>.
            So the formula will be <m>f(x)=x^2</m> when <m>x=2</m> to give <m>f(2)=(2)^2 = 4</m>.
            On the other hand, <m>f(-2)</m> will use <m>f(x)=3-x</m> since <m>x=-2</m> is in the restriction <m>[-2,0)</m>, giving <m>f(-2) = 3-(-2)=5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important piecewise function in mathematics is the absolute value function.
            It is named <m>\mathrm{abs}</m> but can also be represented by vertical bars around the input, <m>\abs(x) = |x|</m>.
            This function creates an output that <em>matches</em> the input (we call this the <term>identity function</term>) when the input is non-negative.
            When the input is negative, the output changes sign by multiplying the input by <m>-1</m>.
            <me>\abs(x) = |x| 
                = \begin{cases}
                x, &amp; x \ge 0, \\
                -x, &amp; x \lt 0.

        <p>
            One strategy for thinking about piecewise functions is to think of the domain on a number line.
            For each restriction, identify that subset on the number line.
            Then label the interval with the formula that gets used on that interval.

            You should be comfortable interpreting the restricted domains that make up a piecewise function.
            In particular, you should be able to recognize where a function is or isn't defined.
            Pay close attention to whether end-points of intervals are included or excluded in a domain restriction.
