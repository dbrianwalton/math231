    <title>Differentiation</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The derivative of a function <m>f(x)</m> at a point <m>x=a</m> is the slope of the tangent line (linearization) of the function.
            In order to make sense of what that would mean, we needed to define the derivative as the <em>limit</em> of the slope of a secant line passing through the point <m>(a,f(a))</m> and another point <m>(a+h, f(a+h))</m> as the second point is chosen closer and closer to <m>x=a</m> by using <m>h \to 0</m>.
            Because this process could be done, in principle, at <em>any</em> point in the domain, this actually defines a <em>function</em> called the derivative function <m>f'(x)</m>, defined whenever this limit exists.
            In certain algebraic cases, we could allow a specific point <m>a</m> to be replaced by a generic variable <m>x</m> and still compute the limit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process described above gives the interpretation and justification for the derivative, but it is tedious as a process.
            Fortunately, there are patterns in the formulas for the derivative function in relation to the formulas for the original function.
            Rules describing these patterns establish a methodical process for calculating the derivative that does not require a limit.
            We will see that each of these rules is justified by the definition of the derivative in terms of limits and the use of limit rules that we learned previously.
        </p>

            <term>Differentiation</term> is the process of finding a derivative.
            This section focuses on how we differentiate formulas, the rules of derivatives, and how to think through the steps of identifying which rules apply in different circumstances.

        <title>Derivative Functions and Polynomials</title>
        <p>
            Polynomials are often used to illustrate that patterns occur in differentiation.
            Rather than go through the work by hand, we can let a computer do the algebra expansion and simplification and then look for patterns.
            One free tool that can do this work is SageMath.
            The cell below provides the steps that SageMath requires to find the derivative using the definition.
            Push the <c>Evaluate</c> button to find the result.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                var('x','h')  # Introduce two variables x and h
                f(x) = x^2    # Define the function
                # Calculate and then display the derivative using the definition
                dfdx = limit((f(x+h)-f(x))/h, h, 0)
                show(dfdx)
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            You should have found that for <m>f(x)=x^2</m>, the derivative is <m>f'(x)=2x</m>.
            Now, modify the cell so that <m>f(x)=x^3</m> and re-evaluate.
            Then try higher and higher powers.
            Can you see the pattern?
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematical notation is often created to reduce repetitive writing.
            It seems tedious to need to name our function <m>f(x)</m> each time we change the formula so that we can talk about its derivative <m>f'(x)</m>.
            We introduce the <term>derivative operator</term> <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m> so that we can focus on the formula.
        </p>
        <p>
            An <term>operator</term> is like a function in that it has an <em>input</em> and an <em>output</em>.
            Instead of taking <em>values</em> as the input, an operator takes an <em>expression</em> or <em>function</em>.
            The derivative operator takes a function as its input and gives the derivative function as the output.
            Our earlier work showed that for <m>f(x)=x^2</m>, we have <m>f'(x)=2x</m>.
            That is, we think of <m>x^2</m> as the input of the step and <m>2x</m> as the output, and write
            <me>\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = 2x</me>.

            Can you see the pattern emerging?
            We want to summarize this pattern as a rule, which we will call the <term>power rule</term>.

            At the moment, we only have looked at a few examples where this pattern holds.
            If we were the first to notice the pattern, we would call this a <term>conjecture</term> until we could <em>prove</em> that our pattern really worked in all cases.
            Fortunately, it actually works for any real number as long as the value is defined. (Some powers of negative numbers don't make sense.)
        </p>
        <p>
            What other patterns can we discover?
            Well, polynomials are formed by adding different powers together and possibly include multiples of powers.
            So let's use SageMath to explore examples like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, let's just add some simple powers together.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                var('x','h')  # Introduce two variables x and h
                f(x) = x^5 + x^3 + x^2   # Define the function
                # Calculate and then display the derivative using the definition
                dfdx = limit((f(x+h)-f(x))/h, h, 0)
                show(dfdx)
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            Try changing which powers are included.
            What do you notice?
            What do you wonder?
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, what happens if the powers are multiplied by a number?
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                var('x','h')  # Introduce two variables x and h
                f(x) = 3*x^5 + 7*x^3 + 4*x^2   # Define the function
                # Calculate and then display the derivative using the definition
                dfdx = limit((f(x+h)-f(x))/h, h, 0)
                show(dfdx)
            </input>

        <p>
            Again try changing the formulas.

            Polynomials, when written as a sum of constants times simple powers, have a very simple pattern for finding their derivatives.
            We create a <em>new</em> polynomial for the derivative.
            We get the same number of terms as the original function, but with terms changing as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    The constant multiple is multiplied by the original power.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    The power on each term goes down by one.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    A <em>linear term</em> in the original polynomial of the form <m>ax+b</m> results in a <em>constant term</em> in the derivative polynomial of the <em>slope</em> <m>a</m>.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                    In the first exercise, our function is <m>f(x)=4x^5+3x^4-7x^2+5x-1</m>.
                    This polynomial is written as a <em>sum</em> of terms that are constants times powers <m>4x^5</m>, <m>3x^4</m>, <m>-7x^2</m>, and a linear term <m>5x-1</m>.
                    This is exactly the form for which our differentiation process can address.

                    The derivatives of the powers will be the same constant multiples times the original power times <m>x</m> raised to a power decreased by one.
                    The derivative of the linear term <m>5x-1</m> will be the slope <m>5</m>.
                    Putting this together, we write:

                    </md>
                    That is, the function <m>f(x)=4x^5+3x^4-7x^2+5x-1</m> has a derivative function <m>20x^4+12x^3-14x+5</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second exercise, our function is <m>f(x)=(3x^2+2x-5)(4x+7)</m>.
                    We need to be paying attention to the structure of the formula.
                    It is written as a <em>product</em>, so our differentiation process is not designed to address the function in this form.
                    We will need to multiply it out (distribute) in order to <em>rewrite</em> the formula so that it is a sum of terms.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>f(x) &amp;= (3x^2+2x-5)(4x+7)</mrow>

                    </md>
                    Now that we have rewritten our function, see that it is a sum of constant multiples of powers <m>12x^3</m>, <m>29x^2</m>, and a linear term <m>-6x-35</m>.
                    Using our polynomial differentatiation rule:

                <p>
                    There is an important observation to make about the notation in the set of equations above.
                    When we <em>rewrote</em> the formula of <m>f(x)</m> from being a product to being a sum, we did not <em>yet</em> use differentiation.
                    So in the notation, you should see that we left the derivative operator alone but changed the formula that appeared <em>as the input</em>.
                    When we actually <em>used</em> differentiation to find derivative terms, we stopped writing <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m>.
                    These equations are saying in essence, <q>The derivative of one formula that is a product is equal to the derivative of a rewritten formula that is now a sum and both are equal to a new polynomial given by a particular new formula</q>.
                    We are <em>not</em> saying that the original function is equal to the final formula that  represents the derivative.
                </p>
            </solution>            
        </example>
        <p>
            Because the power rule <m>\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}</m> is true (we've not yet shown this) for <em>any</em> constant power <m>n</m>,
            the same process we used for polynomials to find a derivative will <em>also</em> work for <em>any</em> function that is written as a sum of constants times elementary powers of <m>x</m>.
            Polynomials require that the powers are nonnegative integers.
            When we have a function that is a sum of term with at least one that is a power <em>other</em> than a nonnegative integer (either a negative integer or a rational number), we will call our function a <term>generalized polynomial</term>.

            One of our learning outcomes is associated with differentiating generalized polynomials.
            You should expect that the first step will be to rewrite the formula as a sum so that our procedure is valid.
            We will soon learn additional derivative rules that allow us to calculate a derivative without this step (product and quotient rules), but this learning outcome focuses on using the generalized polynomial approach.

                    The first example looks at a function that is originally written as a quotient.
                    Because the denominator is a simple power, we can rewrite this in the form of a generalized polynomial.

                    Note that for negative powers, when the power drops by 1, it moves <em>away</em> from zero.
                    A common mistake is to reduce the size of the power rather than literally subtracting 1, which is what is required.

                    The second example looks at a function that is originally written as a product.
                    In addition, the function involves a square root.
                    To proceed with this problem, we need to recognize that a square root corresponds to a power of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                    In addition, we need to multiply out the terms in order to have a formula in the standard representation.
