<p>One way to think about the integral notation is to remember that a derivative is calculated as a limit of a difference quotient, meaning we find the difference <span class="process-math">\(f(x+h)-f(x)\)</span> and calculate the quotient of this divided by <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x = h\text{.}\)</span> In the limit, we think of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \to \frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}\)</span> The inverse operation must involve something like a limit of a product sum. The integral sign <span class="process-math">\(\int\)</span> is an elongated S representing a sum and the product of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(dx\)</span> is the product. When integration is formally introduced, you will indeed learn that it is defined by calculating a sum of terms calculated as a product of a function value times <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\text{,}\)</span> with a limit <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x \to dx = 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
