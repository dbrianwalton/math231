<p>For application problems, one of the key challenges is simply interpreting the question. In this problem, we are asked a question about <em class="emphasis">how fast</em>, which should be interpreted as finding a <em class="emphasis">rate of change</em>. Specifically, we want to find how fast the raindrop is <em class="emphasis">losing water</em>. How do we measure how much water is in a raindrop? That will be a <em class="emphasis">volume</em> of water. So we are being asked to find the rate of change of the volume of the raindrop. If we write <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> for volume and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for time, we need to find <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\text{,}\)</span> the instantaneous rate of change of volume with respect to time.</p>
<p>A second challenge of application problems is interpreting what information we are given. We are told a value of the radius (in millimeters) and how fast it is changing (in millimeters per second). We need a variable for the radius, say <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> The given information is the value <span class="process-math">\(r=0.8\)</span> mm. When we are given a rate of change, that is a derivative, in this case <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt} = -0.05\)</span> mm/s. The value is negative because we know the radius is <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em>.</p>
<p>Once we identify what information is given and what information is desired, we identify equations relating the quantities. From geometry, we start with the equation relating volume <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and radius <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In this equation, both <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> need to be considered as <em class="emphasis">functions</em> of time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> which does not directly appear in the geometric equation. Using function notation, the equation would be rewritten</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(t) = \frac{4}{3} \pi (r(t))^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To find the related rates equation, we need to compute the derivative <em class="emphasis">with respect to time</em>. Because the radius function is raised to a power, the derivative will require the chain rule.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = V'(t) &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[ \frac{4}{3} \pi (r(t))^3 \right]\\
&amp;= \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{d}{dr}[r^3] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[r(t)]\\
&amp;= \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 3 r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}\\
&amp;= 4 \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In the chain rule, the derivative of the outside was <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dr}\)</span> while the derivative of the inside was <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Now that we have the related rates equation, we use the known values to solve for the unknown value. We know at the instant in question <span class="process-math">\(r=0.8\)</span> mm and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}=-0.05\)</span> mm/s. We substitute these values into the equation to get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = 4 \pi (0.8 \, \text{mm})^2 \cdot (-0.05 \, \text{mm/s}) = -0.128 \pi \, \text{mm}^3/\text{s} \approx -0.4021 \, \text{mm}^3/\text{s}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">A negative rate of change occurs because the volume is also decreasing as time passes.</p>
