<p>There are some basic skills and concepts that you are expected to know from previous courses that will be revisited here. We can think of these concepts as roughly being in the following broad categories.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Concepts related to linear relationships, specifically the meaning and application of slope and the equation of a linear relation.</p></li>
<li><p>Concepts relating to sets using interval notation, specifically how to write and interpret a set using intervals and calculating and interpreting the union and intersection of such sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Three basic methods for solving a quadratic equation and being able to identify which method is most appropriate for a given context.</p></li>
<li><p>Solving inequalities using factored expressions through the strategy of sign analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
