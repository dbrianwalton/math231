<p>The process described above gives the interpretation and justification for the derivative, but it is tedious as a process. Fortunately, there are patterns in the formulas for the derivative function in relation to the formulas for the original function. Rules describing these patterns establish a methodical process for calculating the derivative that does not require a limit. We will see that each of these rules is justified by the definition of the derivative in terms of limits and the use of limit rules that we learned previously.</p>
