<p>The last calculation in the example, testing the continuity at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{,}\)</span> feels like circular logic. We wanted to show it is continuous and then used the idea that it was continuous to find the limits required to show continuity. Ultimately, the circularity depends on how you think through it. If you say, “The graph is obviously continuous, so all the values are the same”, then that <em class="emphasis">is</em> circular and bypasses some of the understanding. If instead you say, “To find the limit from the left, I need to look at the segment <em class="emphasis">to the left of</em> <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and see where it approaches as we go back to <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span>”, and it naturally goes back to <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\text{,}\)</span> then you are thinking through the <em class="emphasis">idea</em> of a limit rather than just relying on broken vs unbroken graphs.</p>
