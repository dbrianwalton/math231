<p>Now <span class="process-math">\(x=0.1\)</span> might not be close enough to <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> to create a good approximation. Maybe <span class="process-math">\(x=0.01\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=0.001\)</span> would be better. Or maybe we need to go even closer before the approximation works out well. It might be that none of <span class="process-math">\(M(0.1)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(M(0.01)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(M(0.001)\)</span> are individually close enough (by our judgment) to the value of <span class="process-math">\(M(0)\text{,}\)</span> but we want to have assurances that if we just kept getting closer to <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> we would <em class="emphasis">eventually</em> get good enough approximations. This is where the need for a limit comes from.</p>
