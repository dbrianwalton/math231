<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>We start by using the information about <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> to understand where <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down.</p>
<p>The signs of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> determine the intervals of monotonicity. The signs of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> come from intervals where the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is above or below the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. We see that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Further, we see that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \gt 0\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\((-2,0)\)</span> and on <span class="process-math">\((2,\infty)\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \lt 0\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> will be <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em> on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-2]\text{,}\)</span> increasing on <span class="process-math">\([-2,0]\text{,}\)</span> decreasing on <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{,}\)</span> and increasing on <span class="process-math">\([2,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> Seeing that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \to 0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \pm \infty\text{,}\)</span> we realize that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> will become more and more horizontal on its ends.</p>
<p>The first derivative also allows us to identify where <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has its local minimum and maximum values. Because <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is decreasing on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-2]\)</span> and then increasing on <span class="process-math">\([-2,0]\text{,}\)</span> the graph falls and then rises, meaning that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a <em class="emphasis">local minimum</em> at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span> By similar reasoning, we conclue that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a <em class="emphasis">local maximum</em> at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and another local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span></p>
<p>The signs of <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> determine the intervals of concavity. Because <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> measures the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> we will determine the signs of <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> by looking at the <em class="emphasis">slope</em> of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{.}\)</span> We start by finding <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)=0\text{,}\)</span> where the tangent line of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is horizontal, which occurs at <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -2.9\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.9\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x \approx 0.9\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x \approx 2.9\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is decreasing on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-2.9)\text{,}\)</span> we can see that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) \lt 0\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is concave down on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty, -2.9]\text{.}\)</span> In a similar way, because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> has positive slope for <span class="process-math">\(-2.9 \lt x \lt -0.9\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is concave up on <span class="process-math">\([-2.9,-0.9]\text{.}\)</span> Using the same reasoning on the remaining intervals, we learn that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is concave down on <span class="process-math">\([-0.9,0.9]\text{,}\)</span> concave up on <span class="process-math">\([0.9,2.9]\text{,}\)</span> and concave up on <span class="process-math">\([2.9,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> The function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has inflection points at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2.9\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x=-0.9\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x=0.9\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2.9\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To create the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\text{,}\)</span> we use the same ideas as we used in <a href="sec_fcn_properties.html#subsec_fcn_shape" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.4.4: Describing the Shape">SubsectionÂ 2.4.4</a>. When we learn about definite integrals, we will learn how to compute how <em class="emphasis">much</em> a function increases or decreases based on the area between the graph <span class="process-math">\(y=f'(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{,}\)</span> so here we only focus on matching the monotonicity and concavity we have found. In this case, the areas above and below the axis exactly match, so our graph has the same horizontal asymptote on the left as on the right.</p>
