<p>First, we describe the monotonicity. Looking at the graph, we see it rises, falls, and rises, so we will have three intervals. The function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">increasing</em> on <span class="process-math">\([-4,0]\text{,}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em> on <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{,}\)</span> and increasing on <span class="process-math">\([2,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> End-points were all included because the function values at those points were the lowest or highest value on their intervals.</p>
<p><span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has a global minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=-4\)</span> and a global maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> because it appears the right-edge of the graph is leveling out fast enough that the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value will not get higher than <span class="process-math">\(y=4\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> also has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Second, we describe the concavity. On the far left, the graph starts concave up to the right of <span class="process-math">\(x=-4\text{.}\)</span> To the left of <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> the graph is concave down. We can estimate an inflection point at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is concave up on <span class="process-math">\((-4,-2]\)</span> and concave down on <span class="process-math">\([-2,0)\text{.}\)</span> End-points are not included because the functions does not have clear tangent lines at those points.</p>
<p>The graph is clearly concave up around <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> This extends leftward to <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> By the time we get to <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{,}\)</span> the graph is concave down. An inflection point can be estimated to be at <span class="process-math">\(x=3\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is concave up on <span class="process-math">\((0,3]\)</span> and concave down on <span class="process-math">\([3,\infty)\text{.}\)</span></p>
