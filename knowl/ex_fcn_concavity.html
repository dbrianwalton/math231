<p>The function in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_fcn_concavity_example_left.html" title="Figure 2.4.8">Figure 2.4.8</a> illustrates several intervals of concavity. We start going left to right. When we first encounter the graph around <span class="process-math">\(x=-5\text{,}\)</span> we can see that the graph is locally bending upwards. That is, the graph is above a tangent line on both sides. The curve continues to bend upward until the corner at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span> Assuming the graph has a similar behavior to the left of the viewing window, we would say <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">concave up on</dfn> <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-1)\text{.}\)</span> The point <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> is not included because there is no well-defined slope at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Going from <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> the graph is a straight line. That is, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has no concavity on <span class="process-math">\((-1,0)\text{.}\)</span> Instead, we say <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">linear</em> on <span class="process-math">\([-1,0]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Now, starting at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and going to the right, we see the function is curving downward. Far to the right, however, we see that the curve begins to curve back upward. We need to identify the point where the curving direction switches. In this example, it occurs at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{.}\)</span> If we could draw a tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{,}\)</span> the graph is <em class="emphasis">below</em> the tangent line for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 4\)</span> and <em class="emphasis">above</em> the tangent line for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 4\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, we say <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">concave down</dfn> on <span class="process-math">\((0,4]\)</span> and <dfn class="terminology">concave up</dfn> on <span class="process-math">\([4,\infty)\)</span> (assuming the shape pattern continues outside the window).</p>
<p>The function in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_fcn_concavity_example_right.html" title="Figure 2.4.9">Figure 2.4.9</a> provides an additional example. On the far left, the graph is bending upwards, so we know there will be an interval that is concave up. Looking at the graph at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{,}\)</span> we can see the graph is now bending downwards, so there will be an interval that is concave down.</p>
<p>We check between these points to identify the inflection point. From a graph, we can only give a reasonable guess. The graph appears to be roughly straight for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values close to <span class="process-math">\(x=3\text{.}\)</span> A tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> appears consistent with having the graph <em class="emphasis">above</em> the line on the left and <em class="emphasis">below</em> the line on the right. So <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> being the inflection point is a reasonable guess. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">concave up</dfn> on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,3]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We earlier noted that the graph is concave down around <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Looking further to the right, we should notice that the graph is concave up around <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> It appears that an inflection point is at or near <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span> So we conclude <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">concave down</dfn> on <span class="process-math">\([-3,-1]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Using similar reasoning, we decide there are inflection points at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x=3\text{.}\)</span> We further conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave up on <span class="process-math">\([-1,1]\text{,}\)</span> concave down on <span class="process-math">\([1,3]\text{,}\)</span> and concave up on <span class="process-math">\([3,\infty)\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_fcn_properties.html#ex_fcn_concavity" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
