<p>Suppose that we have the graph of a function <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\text{.}\)</span> Imagine that we look at the graph around a particular point <span class="process-math">\((a, f(a))\text{.}\)</span> In fact, imagine we draw a small rectangle with this point in the center and that we could zoom into the graph so that this rectangle becomes the new viewing window. On a map, this would be called an <dfn class="terminology">inset</dfn>. For smooth functions, if we make the rectangle small enough, the graph looks like a line, at least within the inset portion of the graph. If we allowed that line to continue outside the inset, no longer paying attention to the original graph, that line would be the tangent line.</p>
