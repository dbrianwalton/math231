<p>Foresters are interested in the relationship between the trunk thickness (DBH=diameter at breast height) and total biomass of a species of tree in order to understand the carbon content in forests. (See <a class="external" href="https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_rp591.pdf" target="_blank">USDA Research Paper PNW-RP-591</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.) A stand of Douglas-fir in the Pacific Northwest was sampled and trees with a trunk diameter of 12 cm had an average biomass of 38 kg, while trees with a trunk diameter of 14 cm had an average biomass of 56 kg. Find the average rate of change of the biomass with respect to the trunk diameter based on this data, including proper use of units.</p>
