<p>Isolation works with quadratic equations most simply, as noted above, when the unknown variable is present exactly once. If you ever learned the method of completing a square, this basically creates exactly this situation. The only new concern is that there will be a step where the last operation is the square (raising a term to the power 2). The inverse operation is the square root, except that it is not a true inverse. Every positive number has two roots, one positive and one negative. The square root only calculates the positive root. When we apply the square root to both sides, it is our responsibility to track both possibilities.</p>
