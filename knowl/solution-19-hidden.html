<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(f(-2)\text{,}\)</span> we first interpret notation. The symbol <span class="process-math">\(f(-2)\)</span> stands for the <em class="emphasis">output</em> value of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with an input of <span class="process-math">\(-2\text{.}\)</span> That is, we want the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value of the graph corresponding to the value <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span> The vertical line at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> passes through an open point at <span class="process-math">\((-2,1)\)</span> and a closed point at <span class="process-math">\((-2,-1)\text{.}\)</span> The solid point is the point in the relation, so <span class="process-math">\(f(-2) = -1\text{.}\)</span> The open point represents a <em class="emphasis">limit</em> of the segment of the graph and not an actual point in the graph.</p>
<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(g(2)\text{,}\)</span> we again interpret notation. The symbol <span class="process-math">\(g(2)\)</span> is the output value of the map with input of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> We look in the table of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> The column headed by <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> contains input values while the column headed by <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> contains corresponding output values. Finding <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> in the first column is paired with <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=-4\)</span> in the second column. So <span class="process-math">\(g(2)=-4\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=g(0)\text{,}\)</span> we need to think through a few steps. The symbol <span class="process-math">\(g(0)\)</span> represents an output from <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> corresponding to an input of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Looking in the table with <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> we find <span class="process-math">\(g(0)=1\text{.}\)</span> We <em class="emphasis">replace</em> the symbol <span class="process-math">\(g(0)\)</span> in the equation with this value to restate our question: find <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Notice that the value 1 and the symbol <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> are equal, meaning that we are looking for value(s) <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that the <em class="emphasis">output</em> value <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=1\text{.}\)</span> We now look at the graph at a <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value (horizontal line) <span class="process-math">\(y=1\)</span> and see what point(s) on the graph match. There are three points where the graph's lines cross <span class="process-math">\(y=1\text{,}\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=-5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{.}\)</span> The open point at <span class="process-math">\((-2,1)\)</span> is not an included point of the graph.</p>
<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(g(f(1))\text{,}\)</span> we need to think carefully about what this means. A function name with parentheses means that whatever is inside the parentheses represents the input value. Both <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are functions here. So what is the input? The function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> (outer function) has parentheses surrounding <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\text{,}\)</span> so the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\)</span> is the input. Because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is also a function, its parentheses indicate that <em class="emphasis">its</em> input is 1.</p>
<p>We start with the innermost piece to find <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\text{.}\)</span> An input <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> on the graph is matched with <span class="process-math">\(y=3\)</span> (the closed point), so <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=3\text{.}\)</span> Once we know that value, we <em class="emphasis">substitute</em> to discover</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
g(f(1)) = g(3)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The input <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> for the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is paired with an output <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=-3\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(g(f(1))=-3\text{.}\)</span></p>
