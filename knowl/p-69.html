<p>Intervals and singletons (sets with a single value) form the elementary building blocks for more complicated sets. Suppose we were looking at the graph <span class="process-math">\(y=x^2-1\)</span> and wanted to describe the set of values <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that the graph had <span class="process-math">\(y \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> There are two <dfn class="terminology">disjoint</dfn> pieces of the graph that have <span class="process-math">\(y \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> One piece is where <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\)</span> and the other is where <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 1\text{.}\)</span> This is one set, but it is composed of <em class="emphasis">two</em> disjoint intervals. To make a statement about <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> being in the set, we would need to say <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\)</span> <em class="emphasis">or</em> <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 1\text{.}\)</span> Mathematically, we say that the set is a <dfn class="terminology">union</dfn> of intervals and write <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-1) \cup (1,\infty)\text{.}\)</span></p>
