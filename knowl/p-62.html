<p>We can visualize intervals and sets graphically by highlighting the points on a number line. Since the number line itself is a line, we often draw the interval or set as a thicker line over or next to the number line. Individual points are indicated with solid points. End-points that are not included are indicated with open circles or parentheses. It is also helpful to label the locations of the end-points, especially if the number line itself does not have the location clearly marked.</p>
