<p>The consequence of this theorem is that when we are calculating limits when we know the formula, we really only need to calculate the function value as long as that value exists. If the value of the formula does <em class="emphasis">not</em> exist, then the theorem is silent and does not say how we would calculate the limit. We will learn <em class="emphasis">some</em> strategies for dealing with that case in the next section. In this section, we will use the power of continuity of individual formulas to explore limits and continuity of functions that are defined piecewise.</p>
