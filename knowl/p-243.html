<p>The idea behind a composition <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g(x)\)</span> is in thinking of the overall expression or function as a sequence or <dfn class="terminology">chain</dfn> of two maps (functions) that accomplish the overall sequence of operations. We take the variable and perform some of the operations to find <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span> The rest of the calculation then consists of operations that are applied to that intermediate result. It is often the case that we think of this intermediate result as a dependent variable, say <span class="process-math">\(u=g(x)\text{,}\)</span> and the final result is a function  of <span class="process-math">\(u\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y=f(u)\text{.}\)</span></p>
