<p>If we wanted to be careful, we would also need to learn that there is an order of set operations. Intersection is like multiplication and union is like addition. So if we had three sets <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> the notation <span class="process-math">\(A \cup B \cap C\)</span> would mean the union of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(B \cap C\text{.}\)</span> To avoid worrying about this, we will use parentheses to make things clear. For that example, we would have an unambiguous notation by writing <span class="process-math">\(A \cup (B \cap C)\text{,}\)</span> which is very different from <span class="process-math">\((A \cup B) \cap C\text{,}\)</span> the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(A \cup B\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span></p>
