<p>Mathematics, as a field of study, examines many different types of objects and the patterns that they follow. In order to communicate consistently about these patterns, language is <em class="emphasis">created</em> to describe specific attributes and properties. Words in the context of mathematics are associated with specific definitions. Recall how the idea of inverse functions had a conceptual idea of undoing the operations of one another <em class="emphasis">and</em> a formal definition. The definition was a precise logical statement that we had to precisely verify in order to formally <em class="emphasis">know</em> that our functions were inverses.</p>
