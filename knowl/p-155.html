<p>We should think of sign analysis and the interpretation as separate steps. The previous example involved an inequality with strict inequality. At the end-points, the value of the formula was equal to zero. This is why they were not included in the intervals. If the problem had involved an inequality <span class="process-math">\(\le\)</span> (less than <em class="emphasis">or equal</em>), then each point we found that made the formula equal to zero would also have been included. The sign analysis would be the same; only the interpretation would be different.</p>
