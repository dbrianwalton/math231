<p>To find the union, we look for all values that are in <em class="emphasis">at least one</em> of the sets. With the number line representations, we can scan from left to right. The set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> includes all values until -1, including that value; the set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> immediately begins, also including -1, and continuing until 1. The union must include all of these values. When we look at the value <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we see <span class="process-math">\(1 \not in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 \not in B\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(1 \not in A \cup B\text{.}\)</span> But then <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> starts up immediately and includes all values until 4. The set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> includes all values from 3 until 5. This overlap reduces to a single interval <span class="process-math">\((1,5)\text{.}\)</span></p>
