<p>Arithmetic operations are the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are called <dfn class="terminology">binary</dfn> operations because they use <em class="emphasis">two</em> expressions as inputs to create a new complex expression. The associative and commutative properties of addition and multiplication make it so that we <em class="emphasis">could</em> think of addition or multiplication of more than two values at a time, but then the way we talk about things gets more complicated. Subtraction and division do <em class="emphasis">not</em> conveniently  allow for more than two values. So we will always think of <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the arithmetic operations as being binary.</p>
