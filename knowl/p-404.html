<p>Now, the phrasing that was used involving the idea of “closer” was not quite stated precisely. It is not required that closer values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> cause the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> values to be progressivly closer. Rather, it is about being able to <em class="emphasis">guarantee</em> closeness. A limit is really about <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values being guaranteed to be close to the value of the limit so long as the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values are <em class="emphasis">close enough</em>. Typically, smaller allowable errors for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> will require smaller deviations for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> However, it is typical to use a phrase like “the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>” when stating a limit</p>
