<p>The process of justification of a limit using limit rules starts by thinking through the deconstruction of a formula, as addressed in our earlier learning outcomes in <a href="sec_fcn_construction.html#subsec_fcn_deconstruction" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.2.3: Expression Deconstruction">SubsectionÂ 2.2.3</a>. Each operation that combines two formulas to create a slightly more complex formula will correspond to using a limit rule in a limit justification. Once we have the deconstruction, the elementary functions will be the leaves of the tree. We start by justifying the limits of these functions using the elementary limit rules. Then we work our way up the tree, combining branches one at a time using limit rules of combination, until we have the limit of interest. We do need beware that we don't try to combine limits involving division by zero.</p>
