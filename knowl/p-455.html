<p>This section focuses on limits where the value is undefined because the formula in question would involve division by zero. For algebraic formulas, this means that the denominator has a factor that evaluates to zero. Consequently, our approach will be to attempt to factor the numerator and denominator in the quotient of concern and see if we can find a <em class="emphasis">new</em> formula that eliminates that factor but has the same limit. That is, we want to replace the original formula that has a discontinuity at the point of interest with a new formula that is continuous. If we succeed, the limit is then calculated by formula evaluation.</p>
