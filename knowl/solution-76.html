<p>Our function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is continuous. Because the interval does not include <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{,}\)</span> we are not guaranteed to find a global maximum and minimum. Our strategy will be to find any local extremes inside the interval, and then compare the function values at those points with the end point at <span class="process-math">\(x=-3\)</span> (which is included) and the <em class="emphasis">limit</em> of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> (which is not included).</p>
<p>We start by finding the derivative.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= x^3-12x \\
f'(x) &amp;= 3x^2-12
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We find critical points by solving <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=0\text{.}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
3x^2-12 = 0\\
3(x^2-4) = 0\\
3(x+2)(x-2) = 0
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So we find there are critical points at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)=6x\text{,}\)</span> we can use <span class="process-math">\(f''(-2)=-12\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(2)=12\)</span> to determine that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> and a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We will not know if they are global extremes until we compare the value of the function with the end points.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
f(-2) &amp;= (-2)^3-12(-2) = -8+24=16\\
f(2) &amp;= (2)^3-12(2) = 8-24=-16\\
f(-3) &amp;= (-3)^3-12(-3) = -27+36=-1\\
\lim_{x \to 4^-} f(x) &amp;= (4)^3-12(4) = 64-48=16
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The largest value occured at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has an absolute maximum value of 16 at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span> The absolute minimum value of -16 was attained at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> We used a limit at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> to emphasize that this value is not attained by the function at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> since that end point was not included. If our interval had extended any further to the right and still not included the end point, then the limit at the right end point would have been the largest of all the values and we would have had a function where there was not absolute maximum value.</p>
