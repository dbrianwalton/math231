<p>A function having a derivative goes one step further than a function being continuous. Recall that for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to be continuous at a point <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> is closely approximated by <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as long as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is chosen close enough to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> A derivative gives us additional information about <em class="emphasis">how close</em> the approximations will be and how much change we should expect. In particular, a function that has a derivative will be smooth enough so that close to <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{,}\)</span> the graph should behave <em class="emphasis">almost linearly</em>. The line that approximately matches the function is called the <dfn class="terminology">tangent line</dfn>. The derivative is the slope of that line.</p>
