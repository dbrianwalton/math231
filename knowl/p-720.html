<p>The derivative of a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> at a point <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> is the slope of the tangent line (linearization) of the function. In order to make sense of what that would mean, we needed to define the derivative as the <em class="emphasis">limit</em> of the slope of a secant line passing through the point <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\)</span> and another point <span class="process-math">\((a+h, f(a+h))\)</span> as the second point is chosen closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> by using <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0\text{.}\)</span> Because this process could be done, in principle, at <em class="emphasis">any</em> point in the domain, this actually defines a <em class="emphasis">function</em> called the derivative function <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> defined whenever this limit exists. In certain algebraic cases, we could allow a specific point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to be replaced by a generic variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and still compute the limit.</p>
