<p>In many instances, <em class="emphasis">doing calculus</em> is code for using these rules. The differentiation of polynomials that we explored earlier was an example of using the constant multiple rule along with the sum rule on individual terms that were powers. The power functions were the elementary functions whose derivatives were known. These rules for constructed functions justify why we can treat terms separately.</p>
