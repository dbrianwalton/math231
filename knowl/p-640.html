<p>This table has six entries, comparable to the previous calculation. The last three entries had slope values with digits 5.545 in common, and the last two had 5.5451 in common. Without additional entries, this is the degree of approximation that we might trust, and we would say</p>

<p class="continuation">We don't know if the remaining digits are converging or not, and we don't really even know if the digits we wrote down have converged. This is why the two-sided approach is preferred, but for the assessment, either approach properly demonstrates the idea.</p>
