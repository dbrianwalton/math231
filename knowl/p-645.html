<p>It is helpful to think about the graphical interpretation as we work. Recall that when the slope from the two sides were different because the graph meets at a corner, the function was not differentiable. This will correspond to a calculation where both left- and right-derivatives have values but disagree. We also explored situations where the function had a break (discontinuity). In those cases, at least one of the one-sided derivatives resulted in a limit that was infinite because of a difference between <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> and the limit of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\text{.}\)</span> We should expect these possibilities in our calculations as well.</p>
