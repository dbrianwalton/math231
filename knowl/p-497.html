<p>Now that we know the meaning of limits corresponding to end behavior, we turn our attention to their calculation. The easiest way is to think about extending our view of arithmetic by including calculations <em class="emphasis">with</em> the values of <span class="process-math">\(\pm\infty\text{.}\)</span> In reality, we these calculations are about how limits of a combination is calculated from the limits of the parts, something we call <dfn class="terminology">limit forms</dfn>. The key to this extension is that we must avoid any calculations that would cancel away values that are infinitely big or infinitely small. Such limit forms are called <dfn class="terminology">indeterminate</dfn>.</p>
