<p>The behavior of a function is characterized by its derivative. Consequently, if we know <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> we can graph <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> without knowing the actual function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> itself. <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> will be an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> which means that we don't know an initial value of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and that any graph we create could be shifted vertically up or down to get other antiderivatives. In addition, we currently only know where a function is increasing or decreasing, not <em class="emphasis">how much</em> it actual increases or decreases. When we learn about integration, we will learn that we need to calculate areas from the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> to get this information.</p>
