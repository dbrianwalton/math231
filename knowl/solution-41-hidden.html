<p>We'll need to factor the formula for <span class="process-math">\(R(x)\)</span> eventually. We can use technology to find the factors.</p>
<pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-3"><script type="text/x-sage">numer=x^3-2*x^2-5*x+6
show(numer.factor())
denom=x^3+x^2-8*x-12
show(denom.factor())
</script></pre>
<p>Now that we know <span class="process-math">\(R(x) = \frac{(x-1)(x+2)(x-3)}{(x+2)^2(x-3)}\text{,}\)</span> we look for common factors so that we can interpret the discontinuities. The factors <span class="process-math">\((x+2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x-3)\)</span> are both common factors. After canceling, the simplified formula (which still is naturally undefined at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span>) is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
R(x) = \frac{x-1}{x+2}, \quad x \ne 3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The additional constraint <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 3\)</span> appears because we are talking about equality of equations.</p>
<p>The factor <span class="process-math">\(x+2\)</span> still appears in the denominator but is no longer in the numerator. When we attempt to do the limit, the numerator and denominator limits result in a limit form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -2} R(x) = \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{x-1}{x+2} \to \frac{-3}{0}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Having a non-zero value on top is because <span class="process-math">\(x+2\)</span> is not a factor. When we divide -3 by numbers closer and closer to zero, that ratio gets larger and larger in size, meaning we have an infinite limit.</p>
<p>To determine the one-sided limits, we need to test the sign analysis intervals to the left and right of <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span> The sign analysis number line will need to have breaks at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> (denominator) and at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> (numerator). So if we test using <span class="process-math">\(x=-2.1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=-1.9\text{,}\)</span> we get the signs on the intervals:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
R(-2.1) = \frac{-2.1-1}{-2.1+2} = \frac{-3.1}{-0.1} = +31\\
R(-1.9) = \frac{-1.9-1}{-1.9+2} = \frac{-2.9}{+0.1} = -29
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The sign on the left is positive; the sign on the right is negative:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{x \to -2^-} R(x) = +\infty\\
\lim_{x \to -2^+} R(x) = -\infty
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Because these are different, we say the two-sided limit does not exist, writing</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -2} R(x) \; \text{d.n.e.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For communicating our reasoning, notice that part of our work was in explaining how we knew the limits would be infinite. This is why we needed to show that <span class="process-math">\(x+2\)</span> did not cancel resulting in a nonzero value divided by zero in the limit form. Then we needed to provide reasoning for which infinity each side's limit approached. This is why we needed to reference sign analysis and checking the signs on both sides. A risk on the sign analysis step is choosing test points that are actually not in the appropriate test interval.</p>
<p>For the other limit of interest, the factor <span class="process-math">\(x-3\)</span> canceled completely from the denominator in the simplification. This means the reduced formula is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x=3\text{.}\)</span> The value of the reduced formula will be the limit.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 3} R(x) = \lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x-1}{x+2} = \frac{3-1}{3+2} = \frac{2}{5}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">There is no additional required work.</p>
