<p>There is an important observation to make about the notation in the set of equations above. When we <em class="emphasis">rewrote</em> the formula of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> from being a product to being a sum, we did not <em class="emphasis">yet</em> use differentiation. So in the notation, you should see that we left the derivative operator alone but changed the formula that appeared <em class="emphasis">as the input</em>. When we actually <em class="emphasis">used</em> differentiation to find derivative terms, we stopped writing <span class="process-math">\(\frac{d}{dx}\text{.}\)</span> These equations are saying in essence, “The derivative of one formula that is a product is equal to the derivative of a rewritten formula that is now a sum and both are equal to a new polynomial given by a particular new formula”. We are <em class="emphasis">not</em> saying that the original function is equal to the final formula that  represents the derivative.</p>
