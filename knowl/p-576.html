<p>This sure feels like a lot of work. It is because it is a methodical justification of <em class="emphasis">why</em> we are allowed to evaluate an algebraic formula <em class="emphasis">at</em> a value when calculating a limit, which is formally defined through a statement about inequalities. Any formula constructed only involving arithmetic (including powers that can be rewritten as repeated multiplication) can always be justified following this pattern. The steps will vary for different formulas, but the process is the same. This is why basic algebraic formulas are all continuous.</p>
