<p>For communicating our reasoning, notice that part of our work was in explaining how we knew the limits would be infinite. This is why we needed to show that <span class="process-math">\(x+2\)</span> did not cancel resulting in a nonzero value divided by zero in the limit form. Then we needed to provide reasoning for which infinity each side's limit approached. This is why we needed to reference sign analysis and checking the signs on both sides. A risk on the sign analysis step is choosing test points that are actually not in the appropriate test interval.</p>
