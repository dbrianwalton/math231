<p>The solution follows the same patterns as our example involving individual intervals. The major difference is that we are starting with compound sets. When we graph our representations for <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> we will want to be clear that each set has multiple parts.</p>

With the number line representations, we can scan from left to right. The set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> includes all values until -1, including that value; the set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> immediately begins, also including -1, and continuing until 1. The union must include all of these values. When we look at the value <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we see <span class="process-math">\(1 \not in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 \not in B\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(1 \not in A \cup B\text{.}\)</span> But then <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> starts up immediately and includes all values until 4. The set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> includes all values from 3 until 5. This overlap reduces to a single interval <span class="process-math">\((1,5)\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p class="continuation">Notice how the union has a gap of a single value.</p>
<p>The intersection of the sets looks for points that are in both sets. We look at the original sets to see where they overlap. Both sets include -1, but none of the values immediately to the left or right are in both sets. This will be an isolated value in our intersection. The value 1 might also look like it is in both sets, but in fact is in neither set. The next set of values in the intersection is the interval from -3 to 4. Because <span class="process-math">\(-3 \not \in B\text{,}\)</span> it will not be in the intersection. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(4 \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4 \in B\text{,}\)</span> so it will be in the intersection.</p>
