<p>The idea illustrated above was that a function, when zoomed in far enough, looks like a line, and that if we were to extend that line back out to the original view of the graph, we would get a tangent line. Another way to imagine finding a tangent line is to imagine a line that is anchored to the point of interest <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\)</span> but that can rotate. The tangent line is the line that is chosen so that the line most closely matches the graph around the point of interest on both sides. Or you could imagine a ruler is placed at the point to be following the graph (tangent) and you just draw the line following the straight edge of the ruler.</p>
