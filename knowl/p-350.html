<p>We will return to the definition near the end of the semester when we have defined exactly what <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> means and how to calculate it. For our purposes, we will focus on the interpretation of which direction the curve is bending. An interval of concavity must end as soon as the bending direction switches. We will also only consider intervals on which the graph itself is connected, because we will later learn that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> can not be defined at a discontinuity. We will also not include points where the slope suddenly changes, again because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> won't exist at these points.</p>
