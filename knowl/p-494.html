<p>Another way to think of this is imagining trying to find a box that is unbounded to the right that can contain all points in the graph with <span class="process-math">\(x \gt M\)</span> (for some choice of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>). If the graph itself is bounded, there will be a roof and a floor to the box. The function has a limit <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \to L\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to +\infty\)</span> if the roof and the floor both approach <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> if you make <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> larger and larger. If the roof and the floor are kept apart because the graph keeps oscillating, then the function does not have a limit. <em class="emphasis">Warning: Just looking at a graph can be deceptive because you only ever see a bounded portion of that graph.</em></p>
