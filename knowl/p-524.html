<p>Recall that mathematics as a discipline seeks to understand patterns. Mathematical definitions provide formal statements that codify the idea of a pattern, and deductive reasoning looks for consequences that are provable based on the attributes an object might possess. A function having a limit is one such pattern; a function being continuous is another. Mathematicians have created a definition for a function limit that captures the intuitive ideas about limits we have used relating to graphs and values being approximated from one side or the other. Simple functions can be showed to have limits directly using the definition. Theorems applying the definition of a limit to more complex formulas constructed from simpler formulas that have limits allow us to apply our ideas about continuity to these complex formulas. Together, these theorems justify our ability to compute limits of functions without needing to verify the definition each time.</p>
