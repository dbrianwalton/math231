<p>Rather than jump right into the calculation, it is better to think about what we expect so that we can see if our calculated answer makes sense. In this case, a visualization of what we are calculating is helpful. We can do this by graphing the two points (or at least thinking about the graph).</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/graph_slope_from_two_points.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="graph of a line passing through two points"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Graph of the line joining points <span class="process-math">\((1.8,5)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((3.2,-2)\text{.}\)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notice how the point <span class="process-math">\((3.2,-2)\)</span> is to the right of and below the first point <span class="process-math">\((1.8,5)\text{.}\)</span> We say that the graph of the line is <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em>. This corresponds to a slope that is <em class="emphasis">negative</em>. When we complete our calculation, we want to be sure that we get a negative slope.</p>
<p>As we calculate the slope, it is possible to do it in a single step. Again, it can be helpful to think about it more deliberately by calculating the increments <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\)</span> separately.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\Delta x &amp;= x_2 - x_1 = 3.2 - 1.8 = 1.4\\
\Delta y &amp;= y_2 - y_1 = -2 - 5 = -7
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice how the definition we are following expects that we have identified what we mean by <em class="emphasis">first</em> and <em class="emphasis">second</em> point. We need to be careful that we calculate both increments as the change going <em class="emphasis">from</em> the first <em class="emphasis">to</em> the second point.</p>
<p>Do the values make sense? The increment <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">positive</em> because the second point is <em class="emphasis">to the right of</em> the first point. The increment <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">negative</em> because the second point is <em class="emphasis">below</em> the first point. So we have verified that the <em class="emphasis">signs</em> of the increments are consistent with what we observed in the graph.</p>
<p>The value of the slope (rate of change) can now be directly calculated as the ratio of the increments of change,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-7}{1.4} = -5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The slope is negative as we expected.</p>
