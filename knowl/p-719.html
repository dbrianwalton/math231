<p>In physics, the force of resistance to change provided by an elastic object like a spring is actually a complex nonlinear relation. However, like any differentiable function, for small changes from its equilibrium position, the linearization will be quite close to this nonlinear function. This is why physics typically represents springs using a linear force, known as Hooke's law, <span class="process-math">\(F=-kx\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the <em class="emphasis">displacement from equilibrium</em>. If we represented <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a position and a particular position as equilibrium <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> the equation would intead be <span class="process-math">\(F = -k(x-x_0)\text{.}\)</span> The spring constant <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is actually the derivative or rate of change of the more complex nonlinear force function with respect to displacement.</p>
