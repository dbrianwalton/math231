<p>One way to think about concavity is about a tangent line at a point. The tangent line captures the rate of change of the function at that point. If we took a short segment of the tangent line centered at the point of contact, and this segment would be <em class="emphasis">above</em> the graph immediately to the left <em class="emphasis">and</em> to the right, we would have to <em class="emphasis">bend the segment downward</em> to match our graph. This captures the idea of locally being <dfn class="terminology">concave down</dfn>. If the short segment was <em class="emphasis">below</em> the graph immediately to the left and right, we would have to <em class="emphasis">bend the segment upward</em> to match the graph. This captures the idea of locally being <dfn class="terminology">concave up</dfn>. We just need to see how big we can make an interval to include all the points that locally have such a property.</p>
