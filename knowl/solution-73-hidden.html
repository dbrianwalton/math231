<p>What variables are involved? The water filling the cup forms the shape of a circular cone that fits inside of the cup. Consequently, the radii and heights of the cup and the water cone form similar triangles. Let <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> be the radius of the cone of water at the surface and let <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> be the height or depth of water in the cup. By similarity, we require the ratios <span class="process-math">\(r/4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h/10\)</span> be equal, which results in an equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{r}{4} = \frac{h}{10} \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad 10r = 4h\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<p>We next interpret the quantities that are provided. At the instant in question, we are told water is being added at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}\text{.}\)</span> This is a rate of change and so should be interpreted as a derivative of some quantity. The units <span class="process-math">\(\text{cm}^3\)</span> indicates that we are looking at the rate of change of volume, which makes sense because we can measure the amount of water using units of volume. In addition, we know that the height of water is <span class="process-math">\(h=5 \, \text{cm}\text{.}\)</span> Finally, we are asked to find how fast the height is changing, which means our task is to find the derivative <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We need to create an equation that relates the height and volume of water in the cup. Using the geometric formula for volume of a circular cone, we start with</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">One approach is to use the similarity equation to solve for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
r = \frac{4h}{10} = \frac{2}{5} h\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so that we can write</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{2}{5} h\right)^2 \cdot h = \frac{4}{75} \pi h^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Because <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> are both functions of time, we use the chain rule to find the related rates equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{4}{75} \pi \cdot 3h^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Substituting in the known values, we have an equation leaving <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\)</span> as the only unknown,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s} &amp;= \frac{4}{75} \pi \cdot 3(5 \, \text{cm})^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}\\
&amp;= \frac{4}{75} \pi \cdot 75 \, \text{cm}^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}\\
&amp;= 4\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Solving for the unknown rate, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dh}{dt} &amp;= \frac{10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}}{4 \pi \, \text{cm}^2}\\
&amp;= \frac{5}{2 \pi} \, \text{cm}/\text{s}\\
&amp;\approx 0.7958 \, \text{cm}/\text{s}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>A second approach to this problem is to use the original equation involving both <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> Differentiation this time requires the product rule and the chain rule to give</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dV}{dt} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[ \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right]\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{3} \pi \frac{d}{dt}\left[ r^2 \cdot h\right]\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{d}{dt}[r^2] \cdot h + r^2 \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[h]\right)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(2r \frac{dr}{dt} \cdot h + r^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}\right)
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice that this approach introduces two additional unknowns, <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}\text{.}\)</span> We can find <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> from the similarity relation as <span class="process-math">\(r = 2\,\text{cm}\text{.}\)</span> The similarity relation also leads to a related rates equation between <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
10r &amp;= 4h\\
\frac{d}{dt}[10r] &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}[4h]\\
10 \frac{dr}{dt} &amp;= 4\frac{dh}{dt}\\
\frac{dr}{dt} &amp;= \frac{4}{10} \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{dh}{dt}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Making these substitutions and solving for <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\)</span> will result in the same answer as the first approach.</p>
