<p>Our task is to find the domain of the function. We look at the formula for the potential risk factors: division and even roots. There are two steps involving division and a square root. For each division, we need to look at what is the denominator and ensure it is not zero. For the square root, we need to identify its input and ensure it is not negative.</p>
<p>One division has a denominator of <span class="process-math">\(x+1\text{.}\)</span> We can't divide by zero, so we identify where a problem would occur by solving <span class="process-math">\(x+1 = 0\text{.}\)</span> The method of isolation quickly results in <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> being <em class="emphasis">excluded</em> from the domain.</p>
<p>The second division has a denominator of <span class="process-math">\(x^2+3x-4\text{.}\)</span> After factoring, we see this is rewritten <span class="process-math">\((x+4)(x-1)\text{.}\)</span> A problem occurs if the denominator is zero, so we need to solve <span class="process-math">\((x+4)(x-1)=0\text{.}\)</span> The two solutions at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=-4\)</span> are also excluded from the domain.</p>
<p>For the square root, we need to identify the input expression. What formula is <em class="emphasis">inside</em> the root? We need to require <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \frac{x-3}{x+1} \ge 0\)</span> and so will remove any values causing <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \frac{x-3}{x+1} \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> This is already factored, so sign analysis will be quick.</p>

That portion is defined where sign analysis reveals values that are positive or zero, which occur for <span class="process-math">\(x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup [3, \infty)\text{.}\)</span> The interval <span class="process-math">\([-1,3)\)</span> must all be removed from the domainâ€”removing -1 because it causes division by zero and removing all values <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 3\)</span> because they put a negative value inside the square root.</p>
<p>Once we have considered the restrictions for each risk factor (division and even roots), the domain of the function overall requires that <em class="emphasis">all</em> restrictions are satisfied. If we imagine a number line of potential domain values, we remove <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> for the first division, <span class="process-math">\(x=-4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> for the second division, and all values <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 3\)</span> for the square root. Notice that <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> is not allowed for two reasons. The domain is the set of remaining values,</p>
