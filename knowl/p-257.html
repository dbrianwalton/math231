<p>To understand the rules of calculus, we must be able to look at a formula and understand how that formula is constructed and the order in which the operations are used. This is where we really need the <dfn class="terminology">order of operations</dfn>. Some teachers use the acronym <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">PEMDAS</code> for (1) Parentheses, (2) Exponents, (3) Multiplication, (4) Division, (5) Addition, and (6) Subtraction. In reality, multiplication and division are the <em class="emphasis">same thing</em>, so they happen at the same priority. Similarly, addition and subtraction are really the same thing and have the same priority. When there are multiple items with the same priority, the understanding is that they are completed from left to right.</p>
