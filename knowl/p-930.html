<p>When quantities change with respect to time, all of the different related quantities become functions of time. They also have their own rates of change with respect to time. For the example of a population, the size of the population, the area it occupies, and the population density will all be functions of time with their own rates of change. In this section, we will apply the rules of differentiation treating the different quantities within the equation as functions of time to create equations relating their rates of change.</p>
