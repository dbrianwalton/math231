<p>Consequently, to verify that two functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are inverses, we need to construct the compositions <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f(x)\text{.}\)</span> If both of these compositions reduce to the identity function, then they satisfy the definition. Along the way, we need to practice simplify formulas that involve compositions. This is the second reason that we have this learning objectiveâ€”practicing thinking about the structure of formulas and how the order of operations impacts what does or does not simplify.</p>
