<p>When thinking about numbers on the number line, it is useful to first identify their approximate decimal representation so that we can correctly find their position. The value <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> has an approximate decimal representation of <span class="process-math">\(\pi \approx 3.14159\text{.}\)</span> When thinking about <span class="process-math">\(-\pi\text{,}\)</span> we need to be careful that we put this <em class="emphasis">to the left</em> of -3 on the number line.</p>
<p>For the other non-integer values, we have <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421\)</span> (rounds down) and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.23607\)</span> (rounds up). I made mention of rounding because this technically means that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">between</em> 1.41421 and 1.41422, while <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{5}\)</span> is between 2.23606 and 2.23607.</p>
<p>Once we know where to place the numbers, we can draw our number line. We really only need to include that part of the number line that is useful to illustrate our interval. For example, the interval <span class="process-math">\((-4,-\pi]\)</span> might include a few integers to the left and right of the interval but does not need more than that.</p>

What numbers are outside? You should be able to think about this critically. Because <span class="process-math">\(-\pi \approx -3.14159\text{,}\)</span> you should be able to reason that <span class="process-math">\(-\pi\)</span> is between -3.2 and -3.1. Consequently, -3.2 is <em class="emphasis">inside</em> the interval but -3.1 is <em class="emphasis">outside</em> the interval. Similarly, -3.15 is inside the interval while -3.14 is outside.</p>
<p>The other two intervals are constructed similarly. Be careful about end-points. The value <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">in</em> the interval <span class="process-math">\([\sqrt{2],\infty)\)</span> because the end-point is included. However, if we used a decimal approximation <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\text{,}\)</span> the value 1.414 is <em class="emphasis">not</em> in the interval because this is rounding <em class="emphasis">down</em> from the exact value and so is to the left of the actual end-point.</p>
