<p>For geometric problems, it is often helpful to draw a picture representing the different quantities involved. In this example, we have two roads that are perpendicular, which will correspond to two perpendicular lines. The locations of the vehicles will be points along the line. The distance between the vehicles will correspond to the length of the line segment directly joining the two points.</p>
<p>We are working with a right triangle. Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> measure the distance the first vehicle is from the intersection (along the vertical road), and let <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> measure the distance the second vehicle is from the intersection (along the horizontal road), so that the length of the hypotenuse <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the distance between the two vehicles.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Diagram showing the distances <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> between the vehicles and the intersection and the distance <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> between the vehicles.</figcaption></figure><p>From the provided information about the instant in question, we know the distances from the intersection are <span class="process-math">\(A = 0.25\)</span> mile and <span class="process-math">\(B = 0.5\)</span> mile as well as the rates of change <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dA}{dt} = +30\)</span> mph (because this distance is increasing) and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dB}{dt} = -40\)</span> mph (because this distance is decreasing). We are asked to find <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dC}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Having identified the quantities we know and what we need to find, we need to find an equation that relates the quantities <span class="process-math">\(A, B, C\text{.}\)</span> Because the triangle is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem gives us the equation we need,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C^2 = A^2+B^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice that we don't need to <em class="emphasis">solve</em> for <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> if we think of the equation as relating the <em class="emphasis">squared distance</em>.</p>
<p>We find the related rates equation by creating a new equation about the rates of change. With two different sides to the equation for the squared distance, we will calculated the derivative of both sides of the equation and they must be equal to one another. Remember that all of our variables <span class="process-math">\(A, B, C\)</span> are actually functions of time. On the left, we have the derivative of the square of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> which will require a chain rule (outside <span class="process-math">\(C^2\text{,}\)</span> inside <span class="process-math">\(C(t)\)</span>),</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dt}[\left(C(t)\right)^2] = \frac{d}{dC}[C^2] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[C(t)] = 2C \cdot \frac{dC}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">On the right, we have the derivative of the <em class="emphasis">sum</em> of the squares of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> which will again require the chain rule on each square,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}[\left(A(t)\right)^2 + \left(B(t)\right)^2] &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}[\left(A(t)\right)^2] + \frac{d}{dt}[\left(B(t)\right)^2]\\
&amp;= \frac{d}{dA}[A^2] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[A(t)] + \frac{d}{dB}[B^2] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[B(t)]\\
&amp;= 2A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + 2B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Consequently, the related rates equation is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
2C \cdot \frac{dC}{dt} = 2A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + 2B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Once we have this equation, notice that it involves three different variables and three rates of change. Our goal is to find the value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dC}{dt}\text{.}\)</span> If we solve for that in the equation, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}}{C}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We now all of the values required for the numerator, but we were not provided a value for <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The original equation allows to solve for <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> based on the values of <span class="process-math">\(A,B\text{,}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C = \sqrt{A^2+B^2} = \sqrt{(0.25)^2+(0.5)^2} = \sqrt{0.3125} \approx 0.5590 \, \text{mile}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Using the values, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dC}{dt} &amp;= \frac{A \cdot \frac{dA}{dt} + B \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}}{C}\\
&amp;= \frac{(0.25 \, \text{mi})(30 \, \text{mi}/\text{hr}) + (0.50 \, \text{mi})(-40 \, \text{mi}/\text{hr})}{0.5590 \, \text{mi}}\\
&amp;\approx -22.36 \, \text{mi}/\text{hr}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice how the units work out to give a speed in miles per hour. Because the rate of change is negative, we know that the distance between the vehicles is actually decreasing at this instant.</p>
