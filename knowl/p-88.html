<p>The intersection of the sets looks for points that are in both sets. We look at the original sets to see where they overlap. Both sets include -1, but none of the values immediately to the left or right are in both sets. This will be an isolated value in our intersection. The value 1 might also look like it is in both sets, but in fact is in neither set. The next set of values in the intersection is the interval from -3 to 4. Because <span class="process-math">\(-3 \not \in B\text{,}\)</span> it will not be in the intersection. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(4 \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4 \in B\text{,}\)</span> so it will be in the intersection.</p>
