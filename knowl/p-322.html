<p>This pattern will apply to the properties of other objects in mathematics. We will try to create a common understanding of properties but we will also create formal definitions. The logical consequences for how different properties are related will need to follow based on how the definitions are created. Consequently, definitions can feel cumbersome because they are created as much to facilitate the reasoning in this deductive process as they are to capture natural intuition.</p>
