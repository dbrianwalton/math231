<p>The focus of the measured learning objective is in being able to think through this in reverse. Recognizing a composition involves <em class="emphasis">looking</em> for formula patterns that could have come <em class="emphasis">from</em> this type of substitution. Try to find a sub-expression that involves the variable so that the overall expression consists only of further operations on that formula (and no others variables). That sub-expression would be the intermediate variable in the chain, often generically assigned a name <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span> The outer function is identified by <em class="emphasis">replacing</em> that expression by the intermediate variable. There can often be multiple choices for what to call the intermediate variable.</p>
