<p>The first example is a formula that involves a simple quotient. A <dfn class="terminology">rational function</dfn> is a formula that is the quotient of two polynomials. The main challenge here is (1) writing down the appropriate formula for the slope of the secant line and (2) simplifying the slope quotient by finding a valid common denominator. In addition, it will be helpful to remember that dividing by <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is the same as multiplying by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{h}\)</span> in order to express our slope formula as a simple quotient rather than a quotient of a quotient. If those steps are done properly, we should be able to factor out <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> and cancel it to find a continuous version of the slope formula prior to finding a limit.</p>
