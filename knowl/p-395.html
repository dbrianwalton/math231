<p>Functions can have widely varying behaviors. One of the most fundamental properties of a function is <dfn class="terminology">continuity</dfn>, which is often framed in terms of connectedness. When a function has a break or a jump, it is <em class="emphasis">not</em> continuous or <dfn class="terminology">discontinuous</dfn>. However, mathematicians realized that there is more power in the concept by thinking about continuity as saying that a value of a function is well-approximated by nearby values in the domain. This resulted in the development of the <dfn class="terminology">limit</dfn> of a function, which is at the heart of all ideas in calculus.</p>
