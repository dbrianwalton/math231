<p>The function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> will be the formula in the limit, so <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\)</span> for this problem. The proposed limit is <span class="process-math">\(L=2\text{.}\)</span> Starting with a graph may be most helpful.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.5.5<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Graph of <span class="process-math">\(y=\sqrt{x}\)</span> and thresholds at <span class="process-math">\(y=1.9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=2.1\)</span> that correspond to <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon=0.1\)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our algebraic task is to find these points, so we will be solving the equations <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x} = 1.9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x} = 2.1\text{.}\)</span> The first equation gives <span class="process-math">\(x=1.9^2 = 3.61\)</span> and the second gives <span class="process-math">\(x=2.1^2 = 4.41\text{.}\)</span> The inequality <span class="process-math">\(|f(x)-2| \lt 0.1\)</span> therefore includes the interval <span class="process-math">\((3.61, 4.41)\text{,}\)</span> which does surround <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{,}\)</span> we want to see how big an interval we get that is <em class="emphasis">symmetric</em> around <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> and stays inside of this set. The left end point at <span class="process-math">\(x=3.61\)</span> is a distance <span class="process-math">\(|3.61-4| = 0.39\)</span> away from <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{.}\)</span> The right end point at <span class="process-math">\(x=4.41\)</span> is a distance <span class="process-math">\(|4.41-4| =0.41\)</span> away from <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, if we make our symmetric interval extend <span class="process-math">\(\delta = 0.39\)</span> away from <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{,}\)</span> it will stay inside of both sides of the interval. If we instead chose <span class="process-math">\(\delta = 0.41\text{,}\)</span> the interval will be inside the set on the right, but will go too far on the left.</p>
<p>We always need to choose the smaller distance, which in this case will be <span class="process-math">\(\delta = 0.39\text{.}\)</span> The symmetric interval is <span class="process-math">\((4-0.39,4+0.39) = (3.61,4.39)\text{.}\)</span> The value at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> is not required to be in the set for the limit definition to be satisfied, but in this case because <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> is defined at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> and satisfies the inequality, it can be included.</p>
