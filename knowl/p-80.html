<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(A \cup C\text{,}\)</span> we are interested in values that are in at least one of the sets. Notice that these sets overlap, meaning there are some values that are in <em class="emphasis">both</em> intervals (in their intersection). Consider the boundaries of this overlap. We have <span class="process-math">\(0 \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0 \not in C\text{,}\)</span> but it <em class="emphasis">is</em> in at least one set and so <span class="process-math">\(0 \in A \cup C\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, we have <span class="process-math">\(1 \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 \in C\text{.}\)</span> By being in <em class="emphasis">both</em> sets, it is necessarily in at least one and so <span class="process-math">\(1 \in A \cup C\text{.}\)</span> All values between them are in both sets and so are in the union. The union of these overlapping intervals will be a new interval that contains both,</p>
