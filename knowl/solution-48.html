<p>On a paper version of this problem, you would need to identify points of interest and physically draw the left- and right-tangent lines, or the limits of the secant lines coming from the left and right. As you interact with this graph, imagine how you would do this by hand.</p>
<p>Move the point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span> You should be sure to select the filled in point as the hollow point is just a limit point of the graph. You can now adjust the slider for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> If you approach <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0^-\)</span> by coming from the left (negative <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span>), you should see a left-tangent line has a slope that is approximately 2. This allows us to state:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{x=-2^-} \approx 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">(Do you see how the tangent line appears like it would go through <span class="process-math">\((-3,0)\text{?}\)</span> If doing this by hand, you would use that point to calculate a slope.)</p>
<p>If you approach <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0^+\)</span> by coming from the right, you will see the right-tangent line goes vertical. For <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0^+\text{,}\)</span> you should observe that the slope is negative in the limit so that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{x=-2^+} \approx -\infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We now turn our attention to <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Move <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\)</span> and check what the left- and right-tangent lines (limits of secant lines) look like. The left-tangent line (using <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0^-\)</span>) appears to go through <span class="process-math">\((1,3)\)</span> so that we can approximate</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{x=2^-} \approx -2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Similarly, the right-tangent line (using <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0^+\)</span>) appears to go through <span class="process-math">\((3,2)\)</span> so that we can approximate</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{x=2^+} \approx 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now that we have the left- and right-derivative values, we can interpret the results to say something about differentiability. In both cases, the left- and right-derivatives have <em class="emphasis">different</em> values. So we say that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">not</em> differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
