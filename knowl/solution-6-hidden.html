<p>To visualize this, let us begin by creating a number line and showing each of the three sets <span class="process-math">\(A,B,C\text{.}\)</span> To emphasize that these are being considered as different sets, they are colored differently and placed on different layers.</p>

\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(A \cup C\text{,}\)</span> we are interested in values that are in at least one of the sets. Notice that these sets overlap, meaning there are some values that are in <em class="emphasis">both</em> intervals (in their intersection). Consider the boundaries of this overlap. We have <span class="process-math">\(0 \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0 \not in C\text{,}\)</span> but it <em class="emphasis">is</em> in at least one set and so <span class="process-math">\(0 \in A \cup C\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, we have <span class="process-math">\(1 \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 \in C\text{.}\)</span> By being in <em class="emphasis">both</em> sets, it is necessarily in at least one and so <span class="process-math">\(1 \in A \cup C\text{.}\)</span> All values between them are in both sets and so are in the union. The union of these overlapping intervals will be a new interval that contains both,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A \cup C = (-2,2]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The sets <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> do not overlap and so are disjoint. The union is simply written</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
B \cup C = (0,2] \cup [3,5)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice that the order of intervals in the union is reading the number line left-to-right, and does not match the order that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> were listed in the union. We could have written</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
B \cup C = [3,5) \cup (0,2]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">but this ordering is harder to transfer to a number line and so is not preferred.</p>
