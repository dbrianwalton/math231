<p>Derivatives give us information about slope at a point by finding the limit of slopes connecting nearby points. The consequence of this is that a slope also gives information about those nearby points. The idea of the derivative had started before calculus was formally developed by Newton and Leibniz. Fermat realized a connection between what we now call derivatives and local extremes.</p>
