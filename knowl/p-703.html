<p>Notice how on the far left and far right edges of the graph, the tangent line is almost horizontal so the <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> graph is close to zero on these same edges. Similarly, the graph <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> has horizontal tangents at its local extreme values at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{,}\)</span> so the <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> graph crosses the axis at these points. On the interval <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-2)\text{,}\)</span> the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a tangent line with negative slope, so <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is below the axis on this same interval. You should also notice that the <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> graph has its own local minimum at about <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -3.5\text{.}\)</span> This is a consequence of the graph <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> having an inflection point changing from concave down on the far left to concave up. The corresponding point is where the tangent line has the most negative slope.</p>
