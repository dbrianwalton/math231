<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_fcn_monotone_example_left.html" title="Figure 2.4.3">Figure 2.4.3</a>, we can imagine moving from left-to-right in the domain. As we move along the graph, the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values steadily rise until we reach <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span> Immediately after this point, the graph starts to decrease, so we say the function is <dfn class="terminology">increasing on</dfn> <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-1]\text{.}\)</span> The end-point is included because <span class="process-math">\(f(-1)\)</span> is greater than all values to the left.</p>
<p>Now, starting at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and continuing to the right, the graph continues to drop until <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> The sudden change in slope at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> is irrelevant. We say that the function is <dfn class="terminology">decreasing on</dfn> <span class="process-math">\([-1,2]\text{.}\)</span> Again, both end-points are <em class="emphasis">included</em> because even when the graph is highest at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and lowest at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> and decreasing everywhere in between.</p>
<p>Finally, starting at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> and continuing to the right, the graph is now rising apparently forever (based on the trend as the graph leaves the viewing window). We say that the function is <dfn class="terminology">increasing on</dfn> <span class="process-math">\([2,\infty)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_fcn_monotone_example_right.html" title="Figure 2.4.4">Figure 2.4.4</a>, we again imagine moving from left-to-right in the domain. As we move along the graph, the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values steadily rise until we reach <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span> However, this function has a break or discontinuity. The <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">below</em> the values immediately to the left. Consequently, we say the function is increasing on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-1)\text{,}\)</span> not including the end-point.</p>
<p>Starting at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{,}\)</span> the graph immediately jumps down to a curve which is then rising. We ignore the point at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{,}\)</span> but continue to the right until <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> where the graph has another break. The value at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> is below the points immediately to the left, so we must not include <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> in the set where the function is increasing. The function is increasing on <span class="process-math">\((-1,2)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Now we start at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> The graph immediately drops to a curve, which then continues to decrease. Since <span class="process-math">\(f(2)\)</span> is greater than all of these values <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 2\text{,}\)</span> we will <em class="emphasis">include</em> the end-point at 2 in our interval for decreasing. The graph continues to decrease until the graph stops at <span class="process-math">\(x=5\text{.}\)</span> The value at <span class="process-math">\(x=5\)</span> is lower than points to its left, so this point will also be included. The function is decreasing on <span class="process-math">\([2,5]\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_fcn_properties.html#ex_fcn_monotonicity" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
