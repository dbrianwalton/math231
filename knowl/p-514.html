<p>Polynomials are usually written as a sum of terms. Because limit forms adding <span class="process-math">\(+\infty\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-\infty\)</span> are indeterminate, we need to <em class="emphasis">rewrite</em> polynomials in a new form prior to the limit. Multiplying infinities does not create problems, so our strategy will be to rewrite the sum as a product. We could do a full factorization, but that is more work than is needed. Instead, we factor out the highest power of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> The highest-order term's coefficient will be a constant, and all other terms will be their coefficients divided by a power of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p>
