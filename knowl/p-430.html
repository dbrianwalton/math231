<p>For most students, their experience with functions is that graphs are always continuous. Or at least if they are discontinuous, there is a definite reason like a vertical asymptote. That is because all algebraic functions <em class="emphasis">are</em> continuous, at least at the points in their domains. This is not an obvious fact, and it requires additional mathematical tools to show it is true, some of which we will learn. For this section, we will take as an article of faith (that needs to be justified later) the following statement.</p>
