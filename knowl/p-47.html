<p>First, we identify our variables. As in our earlier example, we will let <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> be the total biomass (kg) and will let <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> be the trunk diameter (cm). The <em class="emphasis">known</em> point is the given information <span class="process-math">\(M=38 \, \text{kg}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D=12 \, \text{cm}\text{.}\)</span> The phrase “increased at a rate” identifies the value <span class="process-math">\(9 \, \text{kg/cm}\)</span> as the rate of change. The word <em class="emphasis">increased</em> indicates that this is a positive value. (To say a quantity decreases would mean it has a negative rate of change.) The phrase “with respect to the diameter” lets us know that we are thinking of <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> as being the independent variable (<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-like). This is reinforced by the units of the rate being <em class="emphasis">kg per cm</em> so that the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-variable is measured in kg and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-variable is measured in cm.</p>
