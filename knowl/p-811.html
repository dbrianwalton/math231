<p>Before discussing the mean value theorem, we first consider Rolle's theorem. This theorem considers a function that is continuous and differentiable on a closed interval so that the end points are at the same <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value. Because it is continuous on a closed interval, the extreme value theorem guarantees that this function has both a maximum and a minimum value. If both extremes are at the end points, then the function must be constant on the entire interval. Otherwise, at least one of the extremes must be at an interior point. But at an interior extreme point where the function is differentiable, we must have <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=0\text{.}\)</span></p>
