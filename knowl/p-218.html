<p>The learning outcomes represented in this section focus on developing this skill.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Find the domain of a function. The process of finding a domain given a formula is based on recognizing some steps in construction, specifically relating to the presence of division or square (even) roots. Once these steps are identified, the process reduces to solving equations or inequalities and interpreting the resulting sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize composition of functions. One of the basic methods of creating a complex function from simple elements, the composition of functions plays a central role in understanding inverse functions and is essential in understanding and using the chain rule and other rules involving substitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Deconstruct a function. All of the rules of calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals) are based on the structure of a formula. Recognizing how a single formula is constructed from smaller units will be essential for later success.</p></li>
