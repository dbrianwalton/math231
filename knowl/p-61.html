<p>Next, a critical understanding requires recognizing that any non-empty interval has infinitely many different numbers inside. Learners often want to think only in terms of integer (whole-number) values, and this interferes with this understanding. For example, some learners want to think of <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt x \lt 5\)</span> as only including integers <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,3,4\}\)</span> or think of <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt x \lt 1\)</span> as being empty (since there aren't any integers between 0 and 1). Be sure to think about fractional values. For example, <span class="process-math">\(0.1 \in (0,1)\text{.}\)</span></p>
