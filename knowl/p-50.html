<p>In typical algebra classes, sets are mainly used in describing solutions to equations or inequalities. This will still be true in calculus, but sets will play a more important role than just summarizing solutions. As we learn more about functions, we will learn that functions are defined in terms of sets. In addition, functions will also be described by various attributes (adjectives) that will be characterized by sets. In preparation, we will need to become practiced in describing and working with sets.</p>
