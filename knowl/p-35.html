<p>In the discussion above, we started with an equation and were basically just randomly picking points and testing if they were or were not in the graph of the equation. One important skill is to be able to <em class="emphasis">create</em> an equation that represents a relation that we want. A second important skill is to be able to <em class="emphasis">visualize</em> the graph of an equation without necessarily trying a lot of different points. Here we will focus on how to <em class="emphasis">create</em> an equation for a line when we know the slope and one point.</p>
