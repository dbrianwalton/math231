<p>In applications, variables represent actual physical quantities. A function relating these variables will need to respect what <em class="emphasis">type</em> of value is used as the input and what type of value is created as an output. For example, if I were doing an electrophoresis gel observation with DNA, then there is a relation between the mass of a DNA segment and the distance it travels through the gel during the observation. If we let <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> be the mass of a segment and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> be the distance traveled, then our observation would create a map <span class="process-math">\(M \mapsto D\text{.}\)</span> If we said <span class="process-math">\(D = f(M)\text{,}\)</span> then the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is expecting <em class="emphasis">mass of a DNA fragment</em> as an input and gives a <em class="emphasis">distance</em> as output. It would not make any sense to talk about <span class="process-math">\(f(M^2)\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(M^2\)</span> is no longer the mass of a fragment.</p>
