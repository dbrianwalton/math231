<p>Problems like this may feel unnatural because we don't even know what these functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> might be. Suppose it were a familiar function, say <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2x} = 3\text{.}\)</span> We would want to get rid of the square root and would do this by squaring both sides. That is, we would use an <em class="emphasis">inverse operation</em>. We will do the same thing here, except the inverse operation to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as a function is the function <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Starting with the original equation, we use composition with the inverse <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> on both sides of the equation:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
f(2x) &amp;= 3\\
g(f(2x)) &amp;= g(3).
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The composition <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f\)</span> reduces to the identity function, which just leaves the input expression. The equation therefore becomes:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
g(f(2x)) &amp;= g(3)\\
2x &amp;= g(3)\\
x &amp;= \frac{1}{2} g(3).
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Because we have isolated <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and the value is a formula involving <span class="process-math">\(g(3)\text{,}\)</span> we are done.</p>
