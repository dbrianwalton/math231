<p>We next interpret the quantities that are provided. At the instant in question, we are told water is being added at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}\text{.}\)</span> This is a rate of change and so should be interpreted as a derivative of some quantity. The units <span class="process-math">\(\text{cm}^3\)</span> indicates that we are looking at the rate of change of volume, which makes sense because we can measure the amount of water using units of volume. In addition, we know that the height of water is <span class="process-math">\(h=5 \, \text{cm}\text{.}\)</span> Finally, we are asked to find how fast the height is changing, which means our task is to find the derivative <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p>
